# `ce-plan`

> Establish the guardrails an implementation needs (decisions, units, files, tests, scope, risks) without prescribing the actual code or step-by-step choreography. Plans capture the WHAT; the implementing agent figures out the HOW.

`ce-plan` produces **decision documents with execution guardrails**, not implementation choreography. The plan captures what decisions have been made, what scope is in or out, what atomic units of work exist, what files each unit touches, what test scenarios must pass, and what risks need mitigation. It does not pre-write code, exact API signatures, or step-by-step shell sequences. Those belong to the implementing agent (`ce-work`, another AI agent, or a human) when code is in front of them.

Plans that pre-write implementation tend to be wrong by the time you implement them: signatures do not compile, choreography is stale, micro-steps hide the real decisions. Plans that capture guardrails stay portable for weeks or months and leave judgment to the implementer.

It works for any multi-step task where structure helps: software features, refactors, bug fixes, study plans, research workflows, event planning, even annual hot-water-tank maintenance. Same engine, same U-ID stability, same right-sized template.

This is the third step in the compound-engineering ideation chain:

```text
/ce-ideate         /ce-brainstorm      /ce-plan             /ce-work
"What's worth      "What does this     "What's needed       "Build it."
 exploring?"        need to be?"        to accomplish
                                        this?"
```

A prior brainstorm is useful context but is never required. Many teams invoke `ce-plan` directly with a requirements-only unified plan, a legacy requirements doc, a GitHub issue, a PRD, a rough description, or a non-software multi-step task.

## TL;DR

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What does it do? | Researches context, captures decisions and scope, breaks work into atomic units with stable IDs, enumerates test scenarios per unit, then auto-strengthens weak sections via a confidence check |
| When to use it | Requirements ready and execution guardrails needed; solo planning when the task is already clear; non-software multi-step tasks; investigative questions that need a structured answer |
| What it produces | Software: a unified plan in `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<type>-<name>-plan.md` (local wall-clock write time, atomically reserved with a numeric collision suffix when needed). Brainstorm-sourced plans move from `artifact_readiness: requirements-only` to `implementation-ready` in place. Non-software plan-seeking writes a domain plan (or publishes to Proof). Answer-seeking delivers the answer in chat and does not write a plan file. |
| What's next | Software: start `ce-work` (recommended), run it as a `/goal` when the host supports that, decide on remaining review items or prototype a remaining feel-question, create a tracked issue, or open an HTML plan in the browser. Non-software: save, publish to Proof, or both. Answer-seeking: the answer is the end. |

## Example invocations

An empty invoke uses the current conversation if one is already underway (including a just-finished brainstorm) and otherwise asks what to plan. Passing a requirements-only plan path enriches that file in place. `output:html` changes the artifact format. `confirm:auto` skips only the pre-plan scope confirmation.

```text
# Use this conversation if it already has a task; otherwise ask what to plan
/ce-plan

# Enrich a requirements-only brainstorm artifact into an implementation-ready plan
/ce-plan docs/plans/notification-mute.md

# Plan directly from an issue or PRD
/ce-plan https://github.com/acme/widgets/issues/1234
/ce-plan docs/product/account-notifications-prd.md

# Bootstrap planning from a clear rough idea
/ce-plan add a background email digest at 8am UTC

# Revisit and deepen an existing implementation-ready plan (interactive accept/reject)
/ce-plan deepen docs/plans/auth-rewrite.md

# Plan a non-software multi-step project (save and/or publish to Proof)
/ce-plan organize a two-day customer advisory workshop

# Answer-seeking: state a plan-of-attack in chat, then deliver the answer (no plan file)
/ce-plan how often does this customer star our repos, and is that a real signal?

# Hold at an approach-plan before committing to the deliverable
/ce-plan plan for a plan: synthesize the three research PDFs into a decision memo

# Write the plan as a self-contained HTML page
/ce-plan turn the notification mute requirements into an implementation-ready plan and make it a self-contained HTML page

# Equivalent shorthand when a repeatable automation needs it
/ce-plan turn the notification mute requirements into an implementation-ready plan output:html

# Skip the pre-plan scoping-confirmation pause for this run only
/ce-plan add a background email digest at 8am UTC confirm:auto

# Keep the session on your usual model; author the plan on a named one
/ce-plan turn the notification mute requirements into an implementation-ready plan, use fable
```

Start with `ce-brainstorm` when the product shape is still unsettled. Direct planning works best when the intended outcome is already clear.

## The Problem

Plans written by humans (or AI without structure) tend to fail in predictable ways:

- Renumbering chaos: refactor the unit list and every reference in the issue, PR, and conversation is now wrong
- Vague test "scenarios": "test the new behavior" tells the implementer nothing
- Forgotten origin context: the brainstorm decided this was for a specific actor, but the plan never mentions them
- Half-resolved questions: "TBD: figure out caching strategy" sitting in the plan months later
- Implementation choreography: exact method signatures, micro-steps, or shell sequences pre-written, then wrong when implementation starts
- No depth check: the author has no signal whether the plan is grounded enough to execute

## The Solution

`ce-plan` separates **what decisions need to be honored** from **how to satisfy them in code**:

- The plan captures decisions, scope boundaries, atomic units, files, test scenarios, and risks
- It does not pre-write code, exact API signatures, or step-by-step shell choreography
- Stable U-IDs survive reordering, splitting, and deletion, so blocker references and PR mentions stay valid
- Plan decisions are traceable back to origin (R-IDs from brainstorm; AE-IDs cited in test scenarios)
- The output contract is decided at intake, before any research: a few sentences in chat (Direct), a chat brief with units and test expectations, or the Durable plan file — see below
- On the Durable path, research runs in parallel before structuring (repo, learnings, framework docs, best practices, spec flow); a Lightweight Durable plan grounds from inline reads instead
- A confidence check runs automatically after writing a Durable plan and dispatches targeted sub-agents to strengthen weak sections
- Planning-time vs implementation-time questions are separated. No fake certainty.

---

## What Makes It Novel

### Three output contracts, decided before research

At intake, after resume and before depth classification, `ce-plan` grounds itself with a few bounded reads of the files the request names and picks one of three results. **Direct**: the work can be stated, done, and verified in one pass with no decision you would weigh — it says what changes in a few sentences and hands off to `ce-work` or to you. **Chat brief**: bounded work with at most one decision and no risk surface — a summary, implementation units with files and test expectations, and a one-line offer to save it or hand it to `ce-work`, all in chat. **Durable**: everything else — the unified plan file with its full floor, confidence check, document review, and handoff menu, exactly as before. When the tier is uncertain the heavier one wins; pipeline and headless runs, goal-driven runs, and risk surfaces (authentication, payments, migrations, external contracts) are always Durable. A saved chat brief is a plain markdown file without the unified-plan contract; re-invoke `ce-plan` on it when you want the full floor.

### Guardrails over choreography

Plans capture decisions and constraints, not code: decisions made (with rationale), scope boundaries, atomic units of work, files touched, test scenarios that must pass, and risks needing mitigation. They exclude exact method signatures, framework-specific syntax, step-by-step shell sequences, and pseudo-code dressed up as an implementation spec. The implementing agent reads the guardrails and figures out HOW with code in front of them.

That is also why the same engine works for non-software tasks. A hot-water-tank-maintenance plan has decisions, units, files-equivalent (which valves, which manuals), test scenarios ("verify no leaks after refill"), and risks, but no code.

### U-IDs that never renumber

Each unit heading is `### U1. Name`, `### U2. Name`, and so on. Existing IDs are never renumbered after reordering, splitting, or deleting. Splits keep the original U-ID on the original concept; new units take the next unused number; deletions leave gaps.

`ce-work` references units by U-ID across plan edits. Renumbering during a deepening pass would silently break every blocker reference, every PR that cites a unit, and every downstream conversation.

### Origin tracing and per-unit tests

When the plan is sourced from a `ce-brainstorm` requirements-only unified plan, identifiers flow through in the same file. Requirements (R-IDs) stay in the Product Contract. Actors (A-IDs) carry forward when they affect behavior or permissions. Key Flows (F-IDs) cite into the units that realize them. Acceptance Examples (AE-IDs) cite into test scenarios (`Covers AE3. <scenario>`). Every Product Contract section is checked against the Planning Contract before finalization.

Every feature-bearing unit enumerates test scenarios from each applicable category: happy path, edge cases (boundaries, empty/nil, concurrency), error/failure paths, and integration. Each scenario names the input, action, and expected outcome.

### Confidence check, then research that matches intent

After the plan is written, `ce-plan` scores sections, picks the weakest ones, dispatches targeted sub-agents (correctness for units, data integrity for migrations, architecture for key technical decisions), and synthesizes findings back into the plan. Auto mode (default during generation) integrates findings directly. Interactive mode (when you ask to deepen an existing plan) presents findings for accept/reject.

Phase 1 always runs local research in parallel (repo patterns and `docs/solutions/` learnings), plus spec-flow analysis for Standard/Deep plans, and optional Slack research. External research is decided by intent, not a single on/off switch. An explicit request ("research competitors", "best practices from the web", "which library") always runs. Implicit signals (thin local patterns, or an unsettled external option set the recommendations depend on) can trigger it too. Implementation-guidance routes to framework docs and best practices. Landscape or option-discovery routes to a web scan. Mixed requests run the landscape scan first, then docs on the shortlist.

### Universal planning and approach altitude

Non-software work skips the software confidence check, but U-IDs, dependency ordering, scope boundaries, verification scenarios, and the right-sized template carry over.

Two dispositions:

- Plan-seeking (a trip, a study curriculum, an event): the saved plan is the deliverable. After writing it, the wrap-up offers save to disk, publish to Proof, or both.
- Answer-seeking (investigative or analytical: "how often does X happen, is it a big deal?"): the answer is the deliverable. The skill states a brief plan-of-attack in chat, executes it (research and synthesis, never code), and does not write a plan file. Only a genuine single-fact lookup skips planning and gets answered outright.

For a hard problem, you can ask one level up: produce a grounded **approach-plan** (a plan for how the deliverable will be made) and hold at a checkpoint. Enter it explicitly (`plan for a plan`, `don't write it yet, plan how you'd approach it`). Rarely, the skill offers this when the method is genuinely unsettled and getting it wrong is costly. After light recon it lays out the approach in chat, file-optional and deepenable. You run it now or save it for later. Code still flows to `ce-work`. A non-code deliverable is marked `execution: knowledge-work` and runs through `ce-work`'s lightweight carve-out. `ce-plan` itself never executes.

### Session-settled decisions are carried, not re-asked

When a decision was examined and chosen in the invoking conversation, or arrives distilled in a caller brief, `ce-plan` records it on its Key Technical Decision as `session-settled: user-directed` or `user-approved`, names what it was chosen over, and never re-asks it. Research may contradict a settled decision only on evidence: nothing found proceeds silently; suboptimal-but-workable proceeds with a conflict call-out; invalidating evidence (infeasible, wrong-thing, destructive) stops the run. In pipeline mode that returns a `settled-decision-invalidated` blocked report. An unexamined assertion is not settled. It earns exactly one plan-time challenge.

---

## Quick Example

You invoke `ce-plan` with a requirements-only unified plan from `ce-brainstorm`. The skill detects `artifact_readiness: requirements-only`, uses the Product Contract as primary input, and verifies no resolve-before-planning blockers remain.

It dispatches research in parallel (repo analyst, learnings researcher). Strong local patterns and no external comparison requested means it skips external research. An explicit "research competitors" or "best practices from the web" request would have overridden that. A spec-flow analyzer runs to surface edge cases. The brainstorm-sourced scoping synthesis surfaces a tier-shaped summary plus zero or more call-outs (the plan-time forks where another reasonable agent might choose differently). Confirm or redirect. Auto-proceed only fires for Lightweight plans with no forks worth flagging. Standard and Deep always get the explicit checkpoint.

The plan is written. The confidence check then runs automatically. It finds `Risks & Dependencies` thin on a mute-leak risk and one unit's tests missing permission edge cases, dispatches reviewers, and synthesizes findings back. The plan is stamped with a `deepened:` date.

Document review then runs in non-interactive mode on markdown or HTML plans. Safe auto-fixes apply silently in the artifact's native format. Remaining findings surface as a one-line summary above the post-generation menu (`Doc review applied 2 fixes. 3 decisions, 1 FYI remain.`). The menu offers: start `ce-work` (recommended), run it as a `/goal` when the host supports that, decide on remaining review items or prototype a remaining feel-question, create a tracked issue, or open the file if it is HTML. There is no Proof option on the software menu, and no pause option. The file is already saved.

## When to Reach For It

Reach for `ce-plan` when:

- You have a requirements-only unified plan from `ce-brainstorm`
- You have a GitHub issue, PRD, or feature description that is already clear enough
- The work is multi-step and benefits from sequencing, dependency ordering, and scope boundaries
- You want test or verification scenarios enumerated before execution
- You are picking up a stale plan and want it deepened (`deepen the plan` or `deepening pass`)
- The task is non-software but multi-step (study plan, event, trip, maintenance, research workflow)
- The question is investigative and you want a structured answer rather than a plan file

Skip `ce-plan` when:

- The change is already specified down to the files it touches and touches no risk surface (just do it, or `ce-work`); if it reaches `ce-plan` anyway, the Direct contract answers in a few sentences
- The product or outcome is not yet decided → `ce-brainstorm` first
- The bug has a known root cause and an obvious fix → `ce-debug` or just fix it

---

## Make It Automatic

If you want planning to run on its own before implementation, add a standing instruction to your agent's instruction file (the repo's `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, or your global one). The activation condition is the part that keeps small changes cheap:

> Before implementing work that spans several files or carries a design decision, invoke the `ce-plan` skill. Skip it for a change already specified down to the files it touches that touches no risk surface (authentication, payments, migrations, external contracts); do that directly or with the `ce-work` skill.

Two phrases are load-bearing: "invoke the `ce-plan` skill", because the slash-command form is not agent-callable on every harness; and the skip clause, because `ce-plan` itself decides its output contract only after it fires — an instruction that invokes it on every change still pays the skill load for a typo.

## Use as Part of the Chained Workflow

```text
/ce-ideate          (optional)
   |
   v
/ce-brainstorm      (define one direction)
   |  requirements-only unified plan: R/A/F/AE-IDs in software mode
   v
/ce-plan
   |  guardrails: U-IDs traced to R/A/F/AE-IDs
   |  test scenarios with AE-link convention (Covers AE<N>)
   |  scope boundaries preserved (including "Outside this product's identity")
   |  confidence-checked and auto-deepened
   v
/ce-work            (execute against the guardrails)
   |  reads U-IDs as the unit of execution
   |  figures out the actual HOW with code in front of it
   |  derives progress from git, not the plan body
   v
/ce-code-review     (optional)
   |
   v
/ce-compound        (capture the learning)
```

The handoff from `ce-plan` to `ce-work` is concrete: `ce-work` reads U-IDs, file paths, scope boundaries, and test scenarios, then determines the actual implementation. The plan tells the implementer **what must be true** when the unit is done. The implementer figures out **how to make it true**.

---

## Use Standalone

Many people reach for `ce-plan` directly when they already know what to do, for software and equally often for non-software multi-step tasks.

**Software:**

- From a GitHub issue: `/ce-plan https://github.com/.../issues/1234` (or paste the issue body)
- From a PRD: `/ce-plan` with the PRD path
- From a rough idea: `/ce-plan "add background email digest at 8am UTC"` runs the bootstrap; the synthesis lets you correct scope before research dispatches
- Re-deepening an existing plan: `/ce-plan deepen the auth-rewrite plan` (interactive accept/reject)
- Cross-repo planning: `/ce-plan "fix the busyblock bug in cli-printing-press"` from a different repo. The target is announced and the plan lands in the target's `docs/plans/`

**Non-software (universal-planning mode):**

- Maintenance tasks, with verification at each unit
- Study plans, with prerequisites and per-unit knowledge checks
- Trip planning: bookings, packing, daily itinerary, contingency boundaries
- Research workflows: gathering, synthesis, drafting, with explicit deliverables
- Event planning: venue, vendors, agenda, day-of run-of-show
- Personal projects: workshop build-outs, home renovations
- Answer-seeking questions, delivered in chat with no plan file

In universal-planning mode, U-IDs, dependency ordering, scope boundaries, and the right-sized template carry over. The software-specific confidence check is skipped.

## Reference

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| _(empty)_ | Uses the current conversation if a task is already present; otherwise asks what to plan |
| `<feature description>` | Solo planning; runs the bootstrap |
| `<requirements-only plan path>` | Enrich the same unified plan in place |
| `<legacy requirements doc path>` | Origin-sourced planning into a new unified plan |
| `<plan path>` | Resume offer (or deepen, if intent matches) |
| `deepen the plan` / `deepening pass` | Re-deepen fast path (interactive mode) |
| `plan for a plan` / `don't write it yet` | Approach-altitude: produce an approach-plan and hold at a checkpoint |
| `<investigative question>` | Answer-seeking: plan-of-attack in chat, then the answer; no plan file |
| `<bug description>` | Routes to a `ce-debug` suggestion menu (skipped in pipeline mode) |
| `<task in another repo>` | Cross-repo announcement; plan lands in the target |
| `output:html` | Write the plan as a single self-contained HTML file instead of markdown. Exclusive: the plan is `.md` or `.html`, never both. Default is markdown. Set `plan_output: html` in CE config (`config.local.yaml` then `config.yaml`) to make HTML the default. Pipeline mode (LFG, `disable-model-invocation`) always forces markdown. See the [configuration reference](./configuration.md). |
| `confirm:auto` | Skip the pre-plan scoping-confirmation pause for this run. The skill writes the scope summary for itself, records inferred scope under `Assumptions`, announces it is proceeding, and keeps going. Genuine blockers and the post-plan menu still appear. Use `confirm:ask` to force the gate on for one run. Set `plan_skip_scoping_confirm: true` in CE config to make skipping the default. |
| `use fable` / `have opus plan this` | Elevate only the interpret-findings-then-author step to that model. Also settable as `plan_model: <model>` in CE config. A prompt request overrides the config key. |

## FAQ

**Doesn't a plan tell you HOW to build something?**
Not in `ce-plan`'s framing. The plan tells you what must be honored: decisions, scope, units, files, tests, risks. It does not pre-write code, exact API signatures, or step-by-step shell choreography. The implementing agent figures out HOW with code in front of them. That same frame is what lets the engine plan a software refactor, a tank-maintenance job, and a 6-week study plan.

**Why U-IDs instead of just numbered units?**
Numbering breaks when units are reordered, split, or deleted. U-IDs stay put. Splits keep the original on the original concept. Deletes leave gaps. `ce-work`'s blocker references work across plan edits because of this.

**Why does the confidence check run automatically?**
The expensive moment to discover a thin section is during execution, not during planning. Auto-deepening runs while research context is still warm.

**What if I want to keep the existing plan and just review it?**
Use the deepen-intent fast path: `/ce-plan deepen <plan>`. It runs in interactive mode. Agents present findings one by one for accept/reject.

**What about implementation code in the plan?**
Disallowed by default. Pseudo-code and DSL grammars are permitted in High-Level Technical Design when they communicate the shape of the solution, framed as directional guidance, not implementation specification. Exact method signatures, imports, framework-specific syntax, and step-by-step shell sequences do not belong in plans.

**Is it really useful for non-software plans?**
Yes. Universal-planning keeps U-IDs, dependency ordering, the right-sized template, and the guardrails-not-choreography frame. Real uses include tank maintenance, study plans, trip planning, research workflows, and event planning. Investigative questions use the same engine but deliver the answer in chat.

**Can I publish a software plan to Proof from the post-plan menu?**
No. Proof is on the non-software wrap-up menu (save, publish, or both). Software next steps are `ce-work`, `/goal` when supported, review or prototype, create an issue, or open an HTML file. Publish a markdown plan later with `/ce-proof` if you want a shareable link.

---

## Model elevation

When you want a specific model for the heavy reasoning step, `ce-plan` can author the plan on that model instead of your session model. Only the interpret-findings-then-author step is dispatched, with read access so it can verify its brief. Dialogue and research stay on your session model. Name a model in the prompt (`use fable`, `have opus plan this`), or set `plan_model: <model>` in CE config (`config.local.yaml` then `config.yaml`). A prompt request overrides the config key.

This works on any harness. The host serves the chosen model natively where it can, otherwise it invokes the Claude CLI (which must be installed and authenticated), otherwise it runs the step on your session model and says which precondition was unmet. Setting `plan_model` therefore takes effect in every harness you run `ce-plan` in, not just Claude Code.
