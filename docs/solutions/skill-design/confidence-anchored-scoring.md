# ce-doc-review confidence scoring: anchored rubric over continuous floats

Persona review originally used a continuous `confidence` (0.0-1.0) against per-severity gates (0.50 / 0.60 / 0.65 / 0.75) and a 0.40 FYI floor. The scale invited false precision: personas clustered on round values (0.60, 0.65, 0.72, 0.80, 0.85) and gate boundaries became coin-flip bands where trivial shifts moved findings in and out of the actionable tier. The model cannot calibrate self-reported confidence at that granularity.

Both review skills now use 5 discrete anchors (`0`, `25`, `50`, `75`, `100`), each tied to a behavioral criterion, ported from Anthropic's code-review plugin (`anthropics/claude-plugins-official/plugins/code-review/commands/code-review.md`). The live anchor definitions, routing, and promotion rules are in each skill's `references/findings-schema.json`, `subagent-template.md`, and synthesis reference, pinned by `tests/pipeline-review-contract.test.ts` and `tests/review-skill-contract.test.ts`. This doc keeps the threshold reasoning those files do not carry.

## Why the doc-review threshold is `>= 50`, not Anthropic's `>= 80`

Anthropic's `>= 80` is load-bearing for code review because of three constraints that invert for document review:

| | Code review | Document review |
|---|---|---|
| Backstop | CI linters, typecheckers, tests catch the 50-75 tier; the LLM only adds value by being more selective | There is no linter for a plan's premise gaps or scope drift; a missed finding derails implementation weeks later |
| Frequency and visibility | Every finding is a public PR comment; a reviewer who cries wolf gets muted | One private review per plan |
| Verifiability | "The code does X" is provable; a 75 often means "could not verify" | "Is the motivation valid?" has no ground truth, so premise/strategy personas legitimately cap at 50-75; `>= 80` would silence them |

So `ce-doc-review` gates at `>= 50` and `ce-code-review` at `>= 75` (with P0 escaping at 50). Anthropic's `>= 80` on a discrete scale would collapse to "anchor 100 only," which silences findings where a persona can construct the trace but cannot literally read the bug off the code, hence 75 rather than 80 for code.

**Correction (2026-08-13).** This reasoning originally continued "let the routing menu handle volume; dismissing a surfaced finding is cheap." That second half was wrong, and it produced a 34-finding review no human would read. Dismissing one finding is cheap; being asked thirty times is not, because the cost is the reader holding thirty open questions at once. A permissive gate is only safe when something downstream converts volume into few decisions. The threshold survives because settled corrections are batched into one grouped confirmation, so a low gate feeds a short question list. Keep `>= 50`; do not keep the reasoning that the menu absorbs volume.

**Correction (2026-09-09).** Batching still leaves the reader evaluating every retained item. Before confidence routing, all reviewer output must pass the same benefit requirement, including FYI observations, residual risks, and deferred questions. Harmless preferences do not become useful because they fit anchor 50. Persona-specific descriptions that admitted them have been removed in favor of the shared rubric. Confidence thresholds remain. Default review permission still covers only certain mechanical fixes; explicit permission from the user or caller may cover corrections within the established scope. Moving concerns between buckets does not establish less user work.

## The anchor-75 boundary

Evaluation on large plans showed personas emitting 75 for premise-strength concerns ("motivation is thin") whose "will be hit in practice" claim was the reviewer's opinion, not a concrete downstream outcome. The template's 75 bullet now requires naming a concrete consequence someone will hit; strength-of-argument critique lands at 50. On the plan that surfaced it, this moved 21 Decisions / 4 FYI to 10 / 23 without suppressing grounded premise challenges (one still promoted to 100 because its consequence was explicit).

## Porting the rubric elsewhere

- A persona-based review skill with no linter backstop and one-shot consumption **that batches settled items** defaults to `>= 50`. Without batching, a low gate hands the reader every finding individually.
- A skill with externalizing modes (PR comments, autofix, headless callers) wants `>= 75` plus an independent validation pass; `ce-code-review` is the reference.
- A pipeline where anchor `25` ("couldn't verify") is most findings may want to surface 25 as "needs human triage" rather than drop it.
- Skip the pattern when the skill produces a single value rather than a population of findings, or the user is the source of truth (interactive Q&A).

Evidence for the migration is thin on purpose: four documents, no labeled corpus, so whether an anchor-75 finding hits 75% of the time is unmeasured. What was confirmed is that score dispersion collapsed from 7-12 distinct floats per document to 2-3 anchors, and that the `>= 50` gate admitted genuine concerns the old graduated gates suppressed at boundaries.
