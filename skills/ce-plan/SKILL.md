# Create Technical Plan

**Note: The current year is 2026.** Use this when dating plans and searching for recent documentation.

**Outcome:** a durable plan artifact an implementer can start from confidently, handed off through its owning terminal workflow. `ce-brainstorm` defines **WHAT** to build as a requirements-only unified plan; `ce-plan` enriches it with **HOW**; `ce-work` executes it. A prior brainstorm is useful but never required.

**When directly invoked, always plan.** If the input is unclear, ask clarifying questions or use the planning bootstrap, but never classify a direct invocation as "not a planning task" and abandon the workflow.

**Research, decide, and write the plan -- never implement.** Do not write production code, run tests, or learn from execution-time results. Directional pseudo-code and grammar sketches may communicate design; changing code to see what happens belongs in `ce-work`.

At every native subagent boundary, classify a rejected dispatch by whether an agent launched: correct a pre-launch argument rejection once, leave capacity-limited work queued, and otherwise follow that boundary's stated fallback or failed-pass handling.

## Mandatory Completion Contract

Every normal interactive branch that produces a plan artifact or checkpoint is incomplete until its owning handoff question is presented. A software implementation-plan run that continues past Phase 0.1b is incomplete until the Phase 5.4 menu is presented and any selected action has actually fired. Non-software and approach-altitude routes use their reference workflow's terminal handoff. Answer-seeking may end after the answer unless its owner requires save/share.

Writing the file, checking confidence, and running or explicitly skipping `ce-doc-review` are intermediate milestones. Pipeline mode is complete only when the plan, confidence check, and non-interactive document-review state are returned to its caller; the caller owns the next action.

## Interaction Method

Ask one question at a time through the host's blocking-question capability. If none exists or it errors, render numbered choices in chat; never silently skip a required question. If no feature description was supplied, ask what to plan and wait.

Every file reference inside the plan artifact is repo-relative. Paths printed in chat are absolute so they remain clickable.

## Task Visibility

For a material multi-stage run, use the host's task-tracking capability when available to show route-level outcomes and meaningful transitions. If unavailable, continue without simulating it in chat.

## Workflow

Phases run in order unless an owner routes out or short-circuits. Read a phase's required reference when that phase is entered, completely; a read made before that phase does not satisfy it, and a terminal owner is read again at its step even when already in context. If a required reference cannot be read, stop before its governed action and report the blocker and recovery path; never reconstruct the missing mechanism from memory. In pipeline mode, every required-owner failure returns `status: blocked`, `phase`, `blocker`, and `recovery_path`; include `artifact_path` and preserve the artifact when one exists. Blocked status outranks artifact presence.

### Phase 0: Output, Resume, and Scope

1. **Output first.** Read `references/output-mode.md` before interpreting any phase. It owns token parsing, output and confirmation precedence, renderer selection, and artifact-root rules. Load it unconditionally, but resolve a workspace, config, or artifact root only when a later route composes a rooted path; no-workspace answer-seeking and explicit-plan-path routes must not acquire a premature workspace dependency.
2. **Resume, deepen, approach, and domain.** Read `references/resume.md` before acting. It owns workspace-backed resume discovery, requirements-only enrichment, deepen fast paths, approach-altitude routing, and the software/non-software split. Follow any terminal route it selects; otherwise continue.
3. **Source and scope.** Read `references/intake.md` before Phase 0.2 and follow it through Phase 0.7. It owns upstream-contract discovery, preservation, bootstrap route-outs, blocking questions, depth, named-resource handling, and solo scoping synthesis. Do not cross a required gate that has not resolved.

### Phases 1-4: Research and Compose

4. Read `references/research.md` before gathering context. It owns local and external research, agent-native triage, consolidation, depth reclassification, and flow analysis.
5. Read `references/structure.md` before resolving questions or structuring the plan. It owns settled-decision handling, stable U-IDs, technical design, depth, and planning boundaries.
6. Compose from `references/plan-sections.md` plus the format-rendering reference selected by `output-mode.md`. Right-size detail without crossing from planning into execution.

### Phase 5: Review, Write, Deepen, and Hand Off

7. Read `references/final-review.md` before pre-write review. It owns Phase 5.1 through 5.3.2, including scoping synthesis, write-path mechanics, unified-plan metadata, confidence mode, and the deepening gate. When directed, read `references/deepening-workflow.md` for steps 5.3.3-5.3.7.
8. **Model elevation.** Immediately before authoring, read `references/reasoning-elevation.md`, resolve the choice at this boundary, and follow it. Do not author until activation resolution has completed and any selected dispatch or transparent fallback has settled. When no model is selected it is a no-op. It runs the same on every harness; do not gate it on the host.
9. In pipeline mode, invalidating evidence against a session-settled decision stops the write. Return the exact token `settled-decision-invalidated`, the decision, and the reason; do not resolve it silently.
10. Write the plan before presenting options, then complete the confidence path owned by `final-review.md`.

**STOP. Read `references/plan-handoff.md` immediately before Phase 5.3.8 and 5.4.** Document review is mandatory and the default is non-interactive (`mode:non-interactive`). The reference owns final checks, menu visibility and rendering, every selected route, and issue creation. In interactive software runs, ask exactly: "Plan ready at `<absolute path to plan>`. What would you like to do next?" Present the owner-defined menu and wait. If the selection arrives after a user turn, reload `references/plan-handoff.md` before acting. Rendering the menu, receiving a selection, or announcing a route is not completion; execute the selected action.
