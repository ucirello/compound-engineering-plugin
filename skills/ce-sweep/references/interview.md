# Sweep First-Run Interview

Loaded by `SKILL.md` when `ce-sweep` runs with `feedback_sources` unset after the ordinary-key cascade. Captures the setup that will be merged into `<workspace-root>/.rocketclaw/config.local.yaml` (the optional local override; interviews write here). Subsequent runs re-read those keys through the ordinary-key cascade (local then `config.yaml`).

This interview is **interactive only**. The caller refuses first-run setup in non-interactive mode — a scheduled or piped run with no config aborts and tells the user to run `ce-sweep` interactively once. Do not attempt to infer sources, actions, or approvals without asking.

**User-runnable invocation rendering.** Whenever this interview prints or registers a `ce-sweep` invocation, default to `/ce-sweep` (plus any arguments); use `$ce-sweep` only when the active host is Codex or explicitly documents dollar-prefixed skill invocation. On oh-my-pi (`omp`), use `/skill:ce-sweep` (plus any arguments). Render only the invocation as inline code and output one form only.

## Interaction Method

Ask **one question at a time** using the host's blocking question tool already in the current tool list (match by capability, not by a host-specific name). Presence in the current tool list is proof the tool exists; never call a user-facing question tool to discover whether it exists. If a matching tool is listed but unloaded, use the host's tool-discovery primitive to load that capability — do not search for another host's tool name. Fall back to numbered options on the host's user-visible chat surface only when no such tool is in the list or a real question call errors — never silently skip a question or assume a default without surfacing it.

## Overall Rules

1. **One source at a time, fully.** Sections 1-3 form a per-source loop: for each source, capture its identity, its acknowledgment actions plus standing approval, and its sensitivity flag before moving to the next source. Do not batch these across sources — a user answering "approve writes" needs to know *which* source they are approving.
2. **Standing approval is consent, captured verbatim.** Section 2's approval question authorizes source-side writes (Slack reactions, GitHub labels) on every future run with no per-run confirmation. Record the literal yes/no. A "no" is not a failure — it leaves that source read-only.
3. **Defaults are shown, not silently applied.** Every question with a default states the default in the question. The user accepts or overrides; you never pick for them.
4. **Capture in the user's own terms.** Config ids, emoji names, and label names are read by the whole team and used verbatim by the connectors — record exactly what the user gives.

## 1. Sources (repeatable loop)

**Opening framing:** "Let's wire up the feedback sources this sweep will watch. We'll add them one at a time — you can add as many as you want."

For each source, ask two things:

1. **Source type** — one of:
   - `slack` — a Slack channel
   - `github-issues` — a GitHub repository's issues
   - `email-experimental` — an email account/folder (experimental; stored in config as `type: email`)
2. **Identity** — depends on the type:
   - Slack: the **channel ID** (e.g. `C0XXXXXXX`, not the `#name`). Stored as `target`.
   - GitHub: the repo as `owner/repo`. Stored as `target`.
   - Email: the account plus a folder/label hint (e.g. `feedback@acme.com / Inbox`). Stored as `target`.

Then assign the source a **short config id** — a stable, lowercase, hyphenated handle the state file and reports use to name this source (e.g. `slack-alpha`, `gh-issues`). Suggest one derived from the type, let the user override. Ids must be unique within `feedback_sources`.

After each source's actions and sensitivity are captured (sections 2-3), ask: **"Add another source?"** Loop until the user is done. At least one source is required to proceed.

**Capture per source:** `type` (`slack` | `github-issues` | `email`), `id` (short handle), `target` (channel ID / `owner/repo` / mailbox hint).

---

## 2. Acknowledgment actions + standing approval (per source)

Every source carries two source-side actions the sweep can perform, plus a standing approval that governs whether it may perform them unattended.

**Ask the acknowledgment action** — what the sweep does to mark an item *seen* on its source:

- Slack: an **emoji reaction** name. Default `eyes`.
- GitHub: a **label** to apply. Default `feedback:ack`.
- Email: none. Email items are tracked only in state; there is no source-side ack. Skip this question for email sources and note that.

**Ask the close-out action** — what the sweep does to mark an item *resolved* on its source:

- Slack: an emoji reaction. Default `white_check_mark`.
- GitHub: a label. Default `feedback:resolved`.
- Email: none — email items stay state-tracked only; explain there is no source-side close-out.

**Then ask the standing-approval question, verbatim:**

> "Do you approve the sweep performing these actions — applying the acknowledgment and close-out `{{action names}}` on `{{source id}}` — on **every future run, without asking you again each time**? Yes authorizes source-side writes for this source going forward. No keeps this source read-only: the sweep ingests and triages items but never touches the source, and items land as `ack_deferred` for you to action manually."

Record the literal answer:

- **Yes** -> `approved: true`. The sweep may apply the ack and close-out actions on this source unattended.
- **No** -> `approved: false`. The source is read-only; its items are tracked as `ack_deferred` and no reaction/label is ever written.

For email sources there are no source-side actions, so approval is moot — record `approved: false` and note the source is inherently read-only.

**Capture per source:** `ack_action` (emoji/label name, or omit for email), `closeout_action` (emoji/label name, or omit for email), `approved` (`true` | `false`).

---

## 3. Sensitive flag (per source)

**Ask:** "Should item content from `{{source id}}` be withheld from recorded state and from plan text? Say yes when the source can carry screen recordings, PII, customer data, or anything you don't want written to a file that may be finalized or shared. When yes, the sweep drops item body and quote before writing state — only titles, urls, ids, and status persist. Default is no."

- **No** (default) -> `sensitive: false`. Full item content is retained in state and available to plans.
- **Yes** -> `sensitive: true`. The state engine drops `body` and `quote` at write time for this source's items, and plans reference items by id/title/url only.

**Capture per source:** `sensitive` (`true` | `false`).

---

## 4. State location

Ask where the sweep's state file lives:

- **Recorded in the JJ workspace** (recommended when multiple agents or machines share a bookmark, so every workspace sees one source of truth). Sets `sweep_state_path` to the default under the artifact root's `feedback-sweep/` — resolve `<root>` to its concrete value first (e.g. the default `docs`), so the persisted value is `<resolved-root>/feedback-sweep/state.yml`, never the literal `<root>` placeholder.
- **Workspace-local under `.tmp/rocketclaw`** (solo setups; keeps sweep bookkeeping outside JJ working-copy changes). In a JJ workspace, first confirm existing ignore rules exclude `.tmp/`; if they do not, offer to add that top-level ignore and stop this path when the user declines. Then resolve the path with this POSIX and Git Bash compatible shell block, substituting a sanitized workspace slug:

  ```bash
  WORKSPACE_ROOT="$(jj workspace root 2>/dev/null)" || WORKSPACE_ROOT="$PWD";
  SCRATCH_ROOT="$WORKSPACE_ROOT/.tmp/rocketclaw";
  if [ -L "$SCRATCH_ROOT" ]; then echo "unsafe scratch root symlink: $SCRATCH_ROOT" >&2; exit 1; fi;
  (umask 077; mkdir -p "$SCRATCH_ROOT") || exit 1;
  if [ -L "$SCRATCH_ROOT" ] || [ ! -O "$SCRATCH_ROOT" ]; then echo "scratch root is not owned by the current user: $SCRATCH_ROOT" >&2; exit 1; fi;
  chmod 700 "$SCRATCH_ROOT" || exit 1;
  SWEEP_STATE_PATH="$SCRATCH_ROOT/ce-sweep/<workspace-slug>/state.yml";
  SWEEP_STATE_DIR="$(dirname "$SWEEP_STATE_PATH")"; (umask 077; mkdir -p "$SWEEP_STATE_DIR") || exit 1; chmod 700 "$SWEEP_STATE_DIR" || exit 1;
  echo "$SWEEP_STATE_PATH";
  ```

  Persist the echoed absolute path as `sweep_state_path`; never persist a placeholder.

Let the user override the path only within the resolved workspace-local `.tmp/rocketclaw` tree. If they pick workspace-local, note that another workspace or machine will not see this state.

**Capture:** `sweep_state_path` (string).

---

## 5. Acknowledgment cap

**Ask:** "What's the most acknowledgments the sweep may perform on a single source in one run before it pauses? This is a circuit breaker against a runaway sweep spamming a channel or issue tracker. When the cap is hit, an interactive run pauses and asks you; a non-interactive run stops acknowledging and defers the rest. Default is 25."

**Capture:** `sweep_ack_cap` (integer, default 25).

---

## 6. Shared bookmark (only if recorded state)

**Skip this section entirely if the user chose workspace-local state in section 4** — the shared-bookmark topology only applies to state recorded in JJ changes.

**Ask:** "Is this a multi-agent setup where several JJ workspaces push the sweep state through one shared bookmark? Answer yes only if more than one machine or agent publishes to that bookmark. Default is no — one workspace records changes locally."

- **No** (default) -> `sweep_shared_bookmark: false`. The single-writer lease serializes overlapping sweeps within one workspace.
- **Yes** -> `sweep_shared_bookmark: true`. Ask for the publication bookmark and Git remote. Explain that the lease becomes **push-gated**: before any source-side write, the sweep finalizes the lease acquisition in a JJ change, moves the publication bookmark to it, pushes only that bookmark through `jj git push`, and confirms the remote bookmark resolves to that change.

**Capture:** `sweep_shared_bookmark` (`true` | `false`), plus `sweep_publication_bookmark` and `sweep_publication_remote` when true.

---

## 7. Legacy import (optional)

Offer to seed state from an existing legacy feedback-tracking file so prior work is not re-ingested and already-acknowledged items are not acknowledged again.

**Ask:** "Do you have an existing feedback state file to import — for example a prior dogfood tracker like `<root>/dogfood-reports/cora-v2-alpha-feedback-state.yml`? Importing carries over its cursors and items so the first sweep skips what's already been processed. Skip if this is a clean start."

- **No / skip** -> proceed to section 8.
- **Yes** -> ask for the file path. Then build a `--source-map`: for each legacy channel/source id in the file, pair it with the configured source id from section 1 (the short name the live connector reads by), as a JSON object like `{"C0AQLMQBGBD":"slack-alpha"}`. This is load-bearing — without it, an imported `C0AQLMQBGBD` cursor lands under `C0AQLMQBGBD` while the connector reads under `slack-alpha`, orphaning the cursor and re-ingesting everything on the first sweep. Run the import from **this skill's directory**; set `SKILL_DIR` inline to the absolute path of the directory containing the `SKILL.md` you loaded:

  ```bash
  SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of this skill's directory>";
  PY="$(for c in python3 python py; do command -v "$c" >/dev/null 2>&1 && "$c" -c '' >/dev/null 2>&1 && { echo "$c"; break; }; done)"; [ -n "$PY" ] || { echo "no working Python 3 interpreter on PATH" >&2; exit 1; };
  "$PY" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/sweep-state.py" import-legacy --state <sweep_state_path> --file <legacy-path> --source-map '{"<legacy-id>":"<config-source-id>"}'
  ```

  where `<sweep_state_path>` is the value captured in section 4 and `<legacy-path>` is the file the user named. Omit `--source-map` only when the legacy ids already equal the configured source ids. Report the `cursors_imported` and `items_imported` counts the command returns. The import is additive and best-effort: it maps what matches known shapes and skips the rest. It does **not** re-ingest source content and does **not** re-acknowledge imported items — mapped cursors carry forward so already-processed items stay processed.

---

## 8. Write config

Merge the captured settings into `<workspace-root>/.rocketclaw/config.local.yaml`. Resolve the workspace root with `jj workspace root`.

- If the directory or file does not exist, create `.rocketclaw/` and write the file.
- If the file exists, merge the sweep keys into the existing YAML, **preserving every unrelated key untouched** (e.g. `pulse_*`, `plan_*`). Only add or update the sweep keys.
- If `.rocketclaw/config.local.yaml` is not already covered by the workspace's ignore rules, offer to add the entry to the workspace-root `.gitignore` before writing. Jujutsu consumes Git ignore files; do not run Git repository commands for this check.

Write these keys (see "Config File Shape" below for the exact form):

- `feedback_sources` — the list of source maps assembled across sections 1-3.
- `sweep_state_path` — from section 4.
- `sweep_ack_cap` — from section 5.
- `sweep_shared_bookmark` — from section 6 (default `false`; only meaningful with recorded state).
- `sweep_publication_bookmark` and `sweep_publication_remote` — from section 6 when shared publication is enabled.

Then surface the resulting Sweep section to the user in chat and offer **one round of edits**.

---

## 9. Schedule offer

**Ask:** "Want the sweep to run on a recurring schedule so feedback gets triaged automatically, or run it on demand? On-demand works fully without a schedule."

- **On demand** -> nothing to register. Note that the rendered `ce-sweep` invocation is ready to run any time.
- **Recurring** -> hand off to whichever scheduling primitive the harness exposes — the in-plugin `schedule` skill if it is installed, otherwise name the platform-native mechanism (cron, GitHub Actions, the host's own automation) and emit a brief hint of what would need to run. **The registered invocation must include `mode:non-interactive`** (deprecated alias `mode:headless` still works if already registered) using the rendering rule above, so the scheduled run knows it is unattended and defers instead of prompting. Never schedule inline; always hand off to the scheduling primitive.

Declining a schedule leaves on-demand use fully working.

**End the interview:** tell the user setup is complete and print the rendered `ce-sweep` invocation for the first run.

## Config File Shape

After the interview completes, merge these flat keys into `<workspace-root>/.rocketclaw/config.local.yaml`, preserving any unrelated keys already present.

~~~yaml
# --- Sweep (ce-sweep) ---

feedback_sources:
  - { type: slack, id: slack-alpha, target: C0XXXXXXX, ack_action: eyes, closeout_action: white_check_mark, sensitive: false, approved: true }
  - { type: github-issues, id: gh-issues, target: owner/repo, ack_action: "feedback:ack", closeout_action: "feedback:resolved", sensitive: false, approved: true }

sweep_state_path: <resolved-root>/feedback-sweep/state.yml   # concrete path; recorded, or <workspace-root>/.tmp/rocketclaw/... for workspace-local use
sweep_ack_cap: 25                                 # max acks per source per run before the circuit breaker
sweep_lease_ttl_minutes: 60                       # single-writer lease staleness threshold; not asked interactively, tunable here
sweep_shared_bookmark: false                      # true: push-gated lease for shared-bookmark topology
# sweep_publication_bookmark: <runtime-selected-bookmark>
# sweep_publication_remote: <runtime-selected-git-remote>
~~~

Notes:

- Each `feedback_sources` entry carries: `type` (`slack` | `github-issues` | `email`), `id` (short handle), `target` (channel ID / `owner/repo` / mailbox hint), `ack_action` and `closeout_action` (emoji/label names; omit both for email), `sensitive` (`true` withholds body/quote from recorded state and plan text), and `approved` (standing approval for source-side writes; `false` keeps the source read-only with `ack_deferred` items).
- `feedback_sources` is a generic key — other skills may read this list.
- `sweep_lease_ttl_minutes` is not asked in the interview; it is written with its default of `60` and left as a tunable the user can edit.
- Email sources are read-only: omit `ack_action`/`closeout_action`, and record `approved: false`.
