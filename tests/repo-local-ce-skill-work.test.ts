// part of the distributed plugin (plugin skills live under `skills/`), so none
// of the plugin-facing tests see it. This guard pins the three facts the
// AGENTS.md pointer depends on: the skill exists at the harness-neutral
// `.agents/skills` path (which Codex and Cursor both discover), the Claude Code
// skills folder is a symlink to `.agents/skills`, and AGENTS.md still routes skill work to it.
