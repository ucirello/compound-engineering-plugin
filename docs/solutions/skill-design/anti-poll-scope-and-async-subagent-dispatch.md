# Scope anti-poll discipline to detached CLI delegates, and collect subagents by observed return shape

## Context

This repository authors each skill once and converts it for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Gemini. A skill's dispatch rules therefore run against whatever subagent primitive the host exposes, and those primitives are not interchangeable. Reworking `ce-code-review`'s reviewer dispatch (PR #1214, addressing issue #1192) exposed the first portability gap: an asynchronous primitive needs explicit collection and slot cleanup. Issue #1523 exposed the inverse gap: even a call requested as foreground may return an asynchronous launch receipt in Claude print mode. Host identity and requested background mode are therefore not reliable dispatch semantics.

The relevant history: the anti-poll discipline (`docs/solutions/skill-design/detached-job-lifecycle-for-delegated-work.md`) was written for the retired ce-work-beta failure mode — a *detached* bash/CLI job plus a foreground `sleep`/status-file poll loop that burned turns waiting on delegated work. PR #1159 over-applied that discipline: it read "no background / no polling" as a ban on *any* concurrency near subagent dispatch and serialized local reviewer dispatch strictly one-at-a-time. PR #1031 had earlier established bounded concurrency. PR #1214 reconciled the two for the primitives then observed; issue #1523 supplied the missing print-mode evidence.

## Guidance

Two rules, both grounded in `skills/ce-code-review/references/dispatch-reviewers.md` (the "Bounded foreground dispatch" paragraph) and the execution spine at `skills/ce-code-review/SKILL.md:27` (step 4).

### 1. Scope the anti-poll ban to detached delegates, not harness-managed subagents

The "no background / no polling / no wakeups" discipline governs *detached* delegates — a background bash/CLI invocation (e.g. `codex exec` for the cross-model peer) that the orchestrator must poll with foreground `sleep`/status-file loops or scheduled "still waiting" turns. It does **not** govern harness-managed subagents (Claude Code `Agent`, Codex `spawn_agent`), which return on their own tool call with no poll loop.

Conflating the two is what made #1159 serialize local reviewer dispatch one-at-a-time, costing 45-70 minutes of wall-clock on large diffs for zero determinism or token benefit — reviewers are independent by construction (none is fed another's output), so batch composition and completion order cannot change any finding. `dispatch-reviewers.md` now draws the line explicitly: the detached cross-model peer "is the only detached work and overlaps with this batch; it does not require serializing harness-managed subagents, which return on their own tool call with no poll loop."

### 2. Collect by observed return shape

A portable rule classifies what dispatch actually returned:

- **Terminal outcome:** the launch is collected. Consume a valid compact result; classify a terminal tool error or malformed output under the workflow's failed/degraded rules.
- **Launch identifier or asynchronous receipt:** the reviewer is uncollected. Use the host's blocking collection capability until the launch reaches a terminal outcome.
- **No reliable blocking collector:** stop the launched work and take the workflow's failure or degraded path. Fail closed only after discharging lifecycle obligations for detached work already started. Never wait for a notification, emit progress-only output, or synthesize a partial roster.

The same classification governs both reviewer batches and later validator batches. A foreground request is an intent, not evidence that a result arrived. A host-specific collector is acceptable only when its live contract shows that it accepts the launch identifier, blocks until terminal, and returns the terminal outcome; a plausible tool name is not enough.

For an asynchronous primitive, the rule still needs three explicit clauses:

- **Collect the complete roster.** Blocking collection waits continue until every successful launch reaches a terminal outcome. These harness-managed waits are not the forbidden detached-delegate poll loop.
- **Release collected agents when the primitive retains slots.** A completed agent can keep occupying its concurrency slot until explicitly closed; release it before refilling and before the validator stage.
- **Guard the transition.** Synthesis cannot begin on launch receipts or a partial roster. If complete collection is unavailable, return the mode-appropriate failure instead.

On a harness that does not run same-message calls concurrently, this identical dispatch degrades to serial automatically — the correct floor, not a failure.

## Why This Matters

Codex review of PR #1214 caught a partial-roster gap and a slot-cleanup gap in its asynchronous primitive. The resulting host-name split still assumed Claude Code supplied an all-return barrier. Issue #1523 falsified that assumption: Claude `-p` recorded local reviewers as background work despite foreground requests, then hit its print-mode background ceiling without returning final review JSON.

The deeper lesson is that a harness label describes neither every version nor every execution mode. When a rule encodes concurrency or pool/refill semantics, the observable result is the contract: a terminal outcome means collected and ready for validation; a receipt means collection remains; no blocking collector means fail closed.

## When to Apply

Apply whenever a skill:

- dispatches multiple subagents with any concurrency, or bounded-pool/refill semantics; or
- carries a rule that forbids "background"/"polling"/"wakeups" near subagent dispatch.

Check three questions:

1. Does the rule treat a foreground request or host name as proof that calls **returned together**?
2. Does it free pool slots by **awaiting alone**? (Deadlocks without an explicit close.)
3. Does it distinguish **detached-delegate polling** (banned) from **harness subagent waits** (fine)? (Conflating them serializes for no benefit.)

## Examples

**Before (host-name classification):** assume Claude foreground calls form an all-results barrier and Codex calls return asynchronous ids. This fails when a Claude print-mode call returns a launch receipt despite background execution being requested off.

**After (observed-result classification):** use a verified blocking collector until every successful launch reaches a terminal outcome; consume valid compact results and classify unsuccessful terminal outcomes under the workflow's failed/degraded rules. Treat every launch receipt as uncollected work, and fail closed if no collector exists. Release collected agents when the primitive retains their slots. The anti-poll ban remains scoped to detached shell/CLI polling, not harness-managed blocking collection.

Primitive contrast:

| Observed dispatch result | State | Required transition |
|---|---|---|
| Valid compact reviewer or validator JSON | Collected | Consume the result |
| Terminal tool error or malformed output | Collected | Classify it under the workflow's failed/degraded rules |
| Launch id or asynchronous receipt | Running, not collected | Use a verified blocking collector until a terminal outcome is in hand |
| No reliable blocking collector | Cannot complete safely | Stop launched work and emit the workflow's failure or degraded result |
| Collected agent still holds a host slot | Complete but not released | Release it before refilling or entering a later subagent stage |
