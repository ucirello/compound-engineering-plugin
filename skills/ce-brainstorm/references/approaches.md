# Phase 2, 2.5, and 2.6: approaches, synthesis, and claim verification

### Phase 2: Explore Approaches

When a Bake-off is explicitly requested for a consequential unresolved product mechanism, read `references/bakeoff.md` before generating approaches. It replaces generation for that question; presentation and scope confirmation below still apply. Otherwise use ordinary generation.

**Model elevation.** Before ordinary approach generation, load `references/reasoning-elevation.md`, resolve the choice at this boundary, and follow its native OpenCode permission, model, depth, receipt, and recovery rules. Do not generate approaches until activation resolution has completed and any selected dispatch or transparent fallback has settled. When no model is selected it is a no-op; proceed normally. Do not suppress resolution because of the host; report any unmet capability through the defined safe fallback.

If multiple plausible directions remain, propose **2-3 concrete approaches** based on research and conversation. Otherwise state the recommended direction directly.

Use at least one non-obvious angle — inversion (what if we did the opposite?), constraint removal (what if X weren't a limitation?), or analogy from how another domain solves this. The first approaches that come to mind are usually variations on the same axis. Hold each approach to an anti-genericness test: if it would appear in a generic listicle for this problem category, sharpen it against the grounding dossier or drop it.

Present approaches first, then evaluate. Let the user see all options before hearing which one is recommended — leading with a recommendation before the user has seen alternatives anchors the conversation prematurely.

If choosing among approaches meets Interaction Rule 7, offer `ce-prototype` there; do not run a design campaign in this skill. If the differences are visual (shape, layout, relationship) and do not meet Rule 7, use `references/visual-probes.md` before presenting the choice. If Phase 0.3 flagged the topic as visual, those differences do not meet Rule 7, and no shape decision has yet been through the text-vs-visual offer, make that offer here, per that reference. The visual path remains opt-in and display-only; text remains a first-class path.

When useful, include one deliberately higher-upside alternative:
- Identify what adjacent addition or reframing would most increase usefulness, compounding value, or durability without disproportionate carrying cost. Present it as a challenger option alongside the baseline, not as the default. Omit it when the work is already obviously over-scoped or the baseline request is clearly the right move.

At product tier, alternatives should differ on *what* is built (product shape, actor set, positioning), not *how* it is built. Implementation-variant alternatives belong at feature tier.

For each approach, provide:
- Brief description (2-3 sentences)
- Pros and cons
- Key risks or unknowns
- When it's best suited

**Approach granularity: mechanism / product shape, not architecture.** Approach descriptions name mechanism-level distinctions ("pause as a rule property" vs "pause as an event filter" vs "pause as a separate entity") and product-relevant trade-offs (plan-tier coupling, complexity surface, migration difficulty). They do NOT name implementation specifics — column names, table names, file paths, service classes, JSON shapes, exact method names. Those are ce-plan's job. Bringing architecture forward at brainstorm time forces the user to make architectural decisions on ce-brainstorm's intentionally-shallow research, and the synthesis at Phase 2.5 then has to filter out the leak.

After presenting all approaches, state your recommendation and explain why. Recommend per Interaction Rule 9: the approach that meets the user's goal with the least added scope, with anything larger offered as the alternative it is.

If one approach is clearly best and alternatives are not meaningful, skip the menu and state the recommendation directly.

If relevant, call out whether the choice is:
- Reuse an existing pattern
- Extend an existing capability
- Build something net new

### Phase 2.5: Synthesis Summary

**STOP. Before composing the synthesis, read `references/synthesis-summary.md`.** It defines what the user sees (the problem as you understand it, what we're building, call-outs), the internal three-bucket draft and where it lands in the doc, the revision loop, soft-cut, and self-redirect. Composed from memory, the synthesis tends to paste the internal draft into chat or leak implementation detail. The Path A / Path B routing below decides only *whether* a confirmation question is asked; it is not the synthesis spec.

Show the user a scoping synthesis before Phase 3 writes the requirements-only unified plan — the user's last opportunity to correct scope before the artifact lands. The scoping synthesis is shaped like what two product collaborators would confirm before writing a PRD, not like a comprehensive audit or a one-line preview.

Runs for **all tiers** including Lightweight. Skip Phase 2.5 entirely on the Phase 0.1b non-software (universal-brainstorming) route.

**Path A vs Path B** is decided by `references/synthesis-summary.md` from two signals: whether any blocking question was asked, and the Phase 0.3 tier. Path A (announce-only, no confirmation) applies **solely** to Lightweight tier with no blocking questions; every other case — including a richly pre-loaded Standard/Deep opener that needed no dialogue — is Path B (the full scoping synthesis, always followed by a confirmation question). Follow the reference's rule exactly; do not decide the path or compose the synthesis from memory.

Session-settled decisions carried in from before this skill started render in the scoping synthesis as `Carrying forward:` lines, never as questions or call-outs — `references/synthesis-summary.md` defines that rendering. Path B rich-context openers carrying prior-session decisions are the common case.

#### 2.6 Claim Verification (inside the Path B confirmation wait)

When the upcoming Product Contract will assert checkable claims about the repo — absence claims ("no retry logic exists"), references to specific files, config, or dependencies, anything planning would build on — dispatch one generation-tier verifier at the same moment the Path B confirmation question goes up, so it runs during the user's think-time. Pass it the claim list (one line each), the grounding dossier path if one exists, and this instruction: verify each claim directly against the codebase — budget ~15 targeted reads — and return a per-claim verdict: **confirmed** (with `file:line`), **refuted** (with the contradicting evidence), or **unverifiable**. Do not block the confirmation question on the verifier.

Consume the verdicts at Phase 3: correct refuted claims before writing, label unverifiable ones as explicit assumptions. A fresh-context verifier replaces self-graded verification — the author confirming its own claims is anchored; the verifier never saw the dialogue.

Skip when Path A applies, when the doc will make no checkable claims, or on the non-software route. Apply `model-tiers.md` before dispatch. Classify actual permission/model-argument/depth/missing-tool failures; correct only an allowed pre-launch argument error once, never retry denial or bypass capacity. If native verification cannot run, verify inline before the Phase 3 write with the same budget and disclose the lost independent pass — Phase 1.1's verify-before-claiming rule still holds either way.
