# Reference bundled skill files by tier: relative for reads, SKILL_DIR anchor for executed scripts

The invariant and `SKILL_DIR` shape stay in `AGENTS.md` under "Platform-Specific Variables in Skills". The three tiers, flatten-safety, and the permission caveat live in `docs/solutions/developer-experience/always-on-agents-md.md`. This doc keeps the lesson behind them.

## Harness fact versus resolution mechanism

The tiers came out of a wrong turn. The empirical finding, *the Bash tool's working directory is the user's project root, not the skill directory, on Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor*, was over-generalized into "bare relative paths like `bash scripts/x.sh` are broken, so anchor every invocation," and codified before being checked against the cross-tool skill spec or any independent implementation. The strong form is false: bare relative paths work in practice, because the thing that resolves the path is the agent, not the shell. The agentskills.io spec says so directly (relative script paths work because "the agent resolves these paths automatically"). Conflating "where the shell starts" with "who resolves the path" produced guidance that diverged from the ecosystem and added unnecessary machinery.

A single empirical finding is not an authoring rule until it is validated against the spec and two or three independent implementations. Vendor docs alone do not settle a cross-harness question; they are platform-centric by construction (Claude Code's docs recommend `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`, exactly the non-portable form to avoid here).

## The evidence that set the tiers

- agentskills.io ships bare `bash scripts/validate.sh` as its canonical example.
- obra/superpowers' `brainstorming` skill runs bare `scripts/start-server.sh` with no anchor across four named platforms; its `subagent-driven-development` skill pairs a bare relative path with a "from this skill's directory" cue (Tier 2).
- mattpocock/skills sidesteps in-place execution entirely (copies a hook into `.claude/hooks/`, or ships a `.template.sh` referenced in prose).
- `last30days` adopted the explicit `SKILL_DIR` anchor for its critical multi-host engine *after* a path-resolution regression.

The tiers reconcile these: relative is the ecosystem norm and works via agent resolution; the anchor is the determinism upgrade reserved for executed shell, where a fenced block copied verbatim into a Bash call otherwise misses (the #764 / #811 / #898 bug class). Apply the anchor only to Tier 3; on Tier 1 and 2 it is noise. `tests/skill-conventions.test.ts` enforces an existence guard only when a skill-dir *platform var* is used, so anchor-based skills pass it.

Open caveat (#949): if a `Read references/X` is ever observed to resolve against the project CWD on a target, treat that read as Tier 2 and add the cue.
