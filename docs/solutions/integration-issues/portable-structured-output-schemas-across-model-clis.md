# Keep structured-output schemas portable across model CLIs

## Problem

Structured-output schemas that cross model CLI or harness boundaries are API contracts, not arbitrary JSON containers: they must stay within the target validator's supported schema draft and vocabulary. In this incident, human-only metadata embedded beside schema keywords caused Claude to reject the request at startup, before the peer model could review anything.

## Symptoms

- The cross-model workers pass their schema as one `--json-schema` argument to Claude and Grok, so a schema startup rejection prevents the route from reaching inference (`skills/ce-code-review/scripts/cross-model-adversarial-review.sh:182-197`, `skills/ce-doc-review/scripts/cross-model-doc-review.sh:197-212`, `skills/ce-pov/scripts/cross-model-pov.sh:193-206`).
- An observed Claude Code 2.1.211 probe rejected both the incident's `_meta` member and an unrelated `x-meta` member with `strict mode: unknown keyword`. The original code-review schema from `HEAD` failed; the current schema with the extension removed reached and succeeded through structured output.
- The rejection was independent of response serialization: default output and `--output-format text`, `json`, and `stream-json` all remained strict whenever `--json-schema` was present. Omitting `--json-schema` avoided startup validation, but returned prompt-only or fenced JSON and forfeited schema-validated output.
- Standard annotations and constraints were not rejected wholesale in the probe: `$comment`, `default`, `examples`, string constraints, and numeric constraints all passed startup. The issue was schema-vocabulary portability, not a blanket prohibition on descriptive schema content.
- The startup failure could also look like a silent empty peer result. The code- and doc-review skip paths captured stderr, but their old unconditional negative-offset slice erased messages shorter than 300 characters on the shipped macOS Bash; the current guarded form makes the slice only for longer strings (`skills/ce-code-review/scripts/cross-model-adversarial-review.sh:645-660`, `skills/ce-doc-review/scripts/cross-model-doc-review.sh:739-754`).

## What Didn't Work

- Treating a declared JSON Schema as an extensible metadata envelope. A custom member may be harmless to a permissive validator yet be an unknown keyword to a strict provider validator; changing its spelling from `_meta` to another extension such as `x-meta` does not solve that boundary mismatch.
- Trying a different Claude output mode. The CLI validates the `--json-schema` payload before response formatting matters. [Anthropic's Agent SDK structured-output contract](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/structured-outputs#output-format-configuration) likewise says invalid schemas fail the run at startup in current releases.
- Removing `--json-schema` as the workaround. That makes invocation more permissive only by abandoning the validated structured-output guarantee that these workers depend on before publishing a fold-in artifact.
- Auditing only the launcher that produced the incident. The repository has three workers that send raw schemas through this boundary, and all three bind file contents directly to `SCHEMA_REF` (`skills/ce-code-review/scripts/cross-model-adversarial-review.sh:267-274`, `skills/ce-doc-review/scripts/cross-model-doc-review.sh:306-313`, `skills/ce-pov/scripts/cross-model-pov.sh:313-320`).
- Capturing an error without testing that short errors remain visible. An expression such as `${value: -300}` asks Bash to start 300 characters from the end; when the string is shorter than that on the affected Bash, the start falls before the string and the expansion is empty.

## Solution

1. Keep the transported artifact a strict schema. Remove custom human-only extension members from the canonical schema and place calibration or operating guidance in standard schema annotations, the model prompt/persona, or a separate non-schema artifact. The current code-review schema keeps its five confidence anchors in the standard `description` for the `confidence` property rather than in a sibling extension object (`skills/ce-code-review/references/findings-schema.json:72-76`).
2. Guard every cross-model schema, not only the one involved in the incident. The contract test recursively distinguishes draft-07 keywords from extension keywords (`tests/review-skill-contract.test.ts:9-118`) and applies the check to the code-review, doc-review, and POV schemas while also pinning their declared draft (`tests/review-skill-contract.test.ts:265-274`).
3. Preserve the structured-output route. The workers continue to pass the complete multi-line schema as one argument; the code-review route test additionally proves that the transported object has no `_meta` member (`tests/skills/ce-code-review-cross-model-routes.test.ts:697-712`), while the doc-review route test protects the one-token argv behavior (`tests/skills/ce-doc-review-cross-model-routes.test.ts:752-774`).
4. Surface startup diagnostics without turning an optional peer failure into a hard failure. For code review and doc review, normalize newlines, slice only when the captured text is longer than 300 characters, and then log the remaining text (`skills/ce-code-review/scripts/cross-model-adversarial-review.sh:652-660`, `skills/ce-doc-review/scripts/cross-model-doc-review.sh:746-754`). POV already uses the same length guard (`skills/ce-pov/scripts/cross-model-pov.sh:687-695`). Functional route tests now pin visibility of a short stderr message for both repaired workers (`tests/skills/ce-code-review-cross-model-routes.test.ts:388-397`, `tests/skills/ce-doc-review-cross-model-routes.test.ts:444-458`).

## Why This Works

The schemas now contain only vocabulary that the cross-model contract admits, while human guidance remains available through standard annotations or prompt-layer material. This preserves provider-enforced structured output instead of trading correctness for a prompt-only JSON convention.

The recursive guard catches extensions at nested schema positions as well as the root, and its three-schema loop prevents a fix from being local to only one consumer. It is a deterministic portability baseline; direct CLI startup probes remain necessary because a provider can support a stricter subset than the nominal draft.

The diagnostic guard fixes the separate observability failure because short strings bypass negative slicing and are logged intact, while strings over 300 characters still receive the bounded tail. Peer startup failures therefore remain non-blocking but no longer masquerade as unexplained no-findings results.

## Prevention

- Treat every schema passed to an external model CLI as a wire-format contract. Target the strictest supported vocabulary shared by the actual providers, not the most permissive behavior of a local JSON Schema library.
- Keep custom human metadata out of transported schemas. Put it in standard annotations only when it genuinely describes the output field; otherwise use prompt/persona prose or a separate artifact.
- Maintain a recursive mechanical guard over every cross-model schema consumer. When a new consumer or schema is added, add it to the shared loop rather than creating a one-off exception.
- Smoke-test the exact production schema against each relevant installed CLI, including startup. Probe custom keywords and representative standard annotations separately so a provider-vocabulary failure is not misdiagnosed as a specific field-name bug.
- Do not assume `--output-format` changes schema validation. Test schema acceptance and response serialization as separate contracts, and do not drop structured validation merely to make startup pass.
- Assert failure-path observability with short and long stdout/stderr fixtures. Any bounded-tail implementation should prove that short messages survive intact and long messages are clipped, especially on the oldest supported Bash.
