# Apply Code Review Findings (after `ce-code-review`)

Load this reference when `ce-code-review` has finished and **ce-work** (or another caller) should apply fixes before the Residual Work Gate.

`ce-code-review` is invoked here with `mode:agent`, so it is **review-only** in this context: it reports findings and writes artifacts but does not mutate the workspace, describe or publish changes, or file tickets. **The caller owns apply/fix policy.**

## Consume the completed review (do not re-run it)

This reference loads **after** review has run. In the ce-work shipping flow, step 3a already invoked `ce-code-review`; this apply step **consumes that output** — do not start a second review, which would waste reviewer dispatches and risk overwriting the artifact the Residual Work Gate reconciles.

Reuse the review output already in hand:

- Parsed JSON (`status`, `actionable_findings`, `findings`, `artifact_path`, `run_id`) **or** the markdown Actionable Findings summary captured by the caller
- Run artifact dir: `<artifact-path>/` (`review.json`, per-reviewer JSON for `why_it_matters`)

If `status` is `failed`, stop shipping and surface `reason`. If `degraded`, note partial reviewer coverage before applying anything.

### Fallback — invoke review only for cold callers

Only when the caller reached this file **without** already running review (no review output in hand): invoke `ce-code-review` once, then proceed to apply. Do not invoke when the caller already ran review (e.g., ce-work shipping step 3a).

Invoke the skill explicitly — do not treat a casual "review my changes" prompt as a substitute unless the harness routed it to `ce-code-review`.

```
ce-code-review mode:agent plan:<plan-path> base:<jj-review-revset>
```

- `mode:agent` — JSON output (`review.json` + primary JSON response) for programmatic parsing; same review pipeline as default.
- `plan:` — when Phase 1 used a plan file (requirements completeness).
- `base:` — when the Jujutsu review revset is already resolved; omit when reviewing a PR number/URL or the active change.
- Do **not** pass deprecated `mode:autofix`.

For human-facing shipping, invoke `ce-code-review` without `mode:agent` if markdown tables are preferred. It still reports only unless the invocation explicitly authorizes local apply. Capture the Actionable Findings and artifact dir before caller-owned apply.

## Inputs for apply

- `actionable_findings` from JSON, or the Actionable Findings section from markdown
- Full finding detail when needed: `review.json` / artifact `findings`, or `{reviewer}.json` for `why_it_matters` and `evidence`
- Stable finding `#` — reuse in change descriptions, residual sinks, and subagent prompts

## What to apply

Default to applying every actionable finding. Applying is a reversible edit to a tracked Jujutsu change; inspect the delta and run tests before describing it.

- **Apply** any finding with a concrete `suggested_fix` that is a clear improvement — the common case. `confidence` and `autofix_class` tell you what to prioritize and what to flag, not whether you may apply: `autofix_class` is signal, **never permission**.
- **Push back** — keep the finding, don't apply — when the reviewer is wrong; note why.
- **Flag, don't block, green-but-unverifiable edits** — when an applied fix touches auth/authz, a public or cross-service contract/schema, or concurrency, a passing test does not prove safety; apply it when there is a clear `suggested_fix` and confidence, and call it out prominently in the Jujutsu delta review.

There is no precondition safety checklist and no deny-list; downside is controlled by Jujutsu operation recovery, delta review, and tests.

**Evidence still matches the code** — the fix subagent confirms at `file:line` before editing. The orchestrator does **not** open files just to decide eligibility or dispatch.

## What to defer (to the Residual Work Gate)

- `autofix_class: advisory` — report-only.
- Findings with no concrete `suggested_fix` to act on.
- Findings whose right fix depends on a design or product decision — architecture direction, contract shape, or a behavior change needing sign-off. These need a human call before code changes.

Surface what was deferred and why; never silently drop.

## Execution — orchestrator batches, subagents apply

The orchestrator **does not investigate findings** (no pre-read of cited files to judge complexity or inline vs subagent). That would spend the context window you are trying to protect.

**Orchestrator owns:** parse review output -> **eligibility filter on JSON fields only** -> build batches -> dispatch fix subagents -> review Jujutsu deltas -> tests -> describe the change -> Residual Work Gate.

**Fix subagents own:** read `file:line`, confirm evidence still matches, apply or skip with reason, return summary.

### Default: batched fix subagents

After eligibility filtering, **dispatch subagents for all remaining applicable findings** unless the optional inline shortcut below applies. Do not classify findings by complexity in the parent thread.

**Batching (primary rule — group by file):**

1. Sort applicable findings by severity (P0 first).
2. **Group by `file`.** All eligible findings on the same file → **one subagent** (it loads the file once and works through its `#` list in severity order).
3. **Parallel waves:** batches with **disjoint file sets** may run in parallel under the same isolated-workspace/shared-workspace rules as Phase 1 Step 4.
4. **Same file, many findings:** keep one subagent per file. If the prompt would exceed a comfortable size (~8 findings), split into serial passes on that file.
5. **Cross-file coupling:** do not combine unrelated files merely to reduce agent count. Co-batch only when findings explicitly share one small edit surface.

**Subagent prompt (per batch):** the assigned findings only (`#`, severity, file, line, title, `suggested_fix`, `requires_verification`; add `why_it_matters` from `{reviewer}.json` in the run artifact when useful), plus:
- Work through assigned `#` in severity order; at each `file:line`, skip with a one-line reason if evidence no longer matches
- Apply the mechanical bar from § What to apply / What not to apply — skip anything that needs design judgment
- Do not re-run `ce-code-review`
- Shared-workspace fallback: do not alter descriptions, ancestry, bookmarks, operations, or remotes; return which `#` were applied or skipped and which files changed

**After each wave:** the orchestrator reviews `jj diff` (scope = assigned `#` only) and runs required tests. Based on https://go.dev/wiki/CommitMessage and on past commit messages that you can see in `git log`, compose commit messages adherent to the present standards. Runtime local conventions win; use a dynamic `jj describe` value that preserves the finding IDs' semantic content without imposing a fixed type or scope. Start a fresh change only after the reviewed fix change is complete.

### Optional inline shortcut (skip subagent spawn)

Use **only** when **all** of the following hold:

- Exactly **one** eligible finding after JSON filtering, **and**
- The orchestrator **already** has that file's relevant region in context from Phase 2 work this session (no new Read/Grep expedition)

Otherwise dispatch a subagent — even for a single finding. When unsure, dispatch.

### Summary (required)

Report: batches dispatched, `#` applied vs skipped (with reasons from subagents), artifact path, tests run.

## Handoff to Residual Work Gate

Any actionable finding not applied in this pass is **residual work** — proceed to the Residual Work Gate with an updated count. Do not re-invoke `ce-code-review` solely to re-apply the same findings unless the diff changed materially after fixes.
