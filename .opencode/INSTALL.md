# Installing Compound Engineering for OpenCode

Add Compound Engineering to the `plugin` array in your global or project `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["compound-engineering@git+https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin.git"]
}
```

Restart OpenCode after changing the config. The bundled entrypoint supports both the legacy OpenCode v1 plugin loader and the OpenCode v2 plugin loader, so the same declaration works with either binary. It registers the Compound Engineering skills directly; no Bun installer or generated skill copy is required.

To pin a release, add a tag. Replace `X.Y.Z` with the release you want — see the [releases page](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/releases) for available tags:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["compound-engineering@git+https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin.git#compound-engineering-vX.Y.Z"]
}
```

## Local Development

From this checkout, point OpenCode at the package path:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["/path/to/compound-engineering-plugin"]
}
```

Restart OpenCode after changing the package source.
