# Old-PR intake

A PR whose base has moved under it can rebase cleanly and still not belong anymore: the base may already solve the same problem, or may have deleted, moved, or deliberately simplified the code the PR changes. Git conflicts only show textual overlap. This step decides, before anything is pushed, whether the PR should be updated, reworked, or closed, and it owns the one history rewrite babysit performs.

**Result:** one verdict with its evidence, and for an authorized Update a rebased head that kept the PR's intended changes and brought back nothing the base already landed. **Safe failure direction:** when the evidence is incomplete, report what is missing and push nothing.

## When it runs

Run it once per fresh invocation, after the PR is resolved and before the checkout gate in Step 1. A run that continues an existing invocation (a checkpoint resume, a scheduler re-entry, or a stack transition) skips it, so a long watch does not change verdicts mid-run. A live user message mid-watch that asks to update, rebase, or reassess the PR runs it again: stop the watcher, run this step, then continue.

Run the bundled overlap check against fresh refs. Pass the local remote whose URL is the PR's base repository (the repository in the PR's URL); in a fork checkout that is often not `origin`:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of this skill's directory>";
PY="$(for c in python3 python py; do command -v "$c" >/dev/null 2>&1 && "$c" -c '' >/dev/null 2>&1 && { echo "$c"; break; }; done)"; [ -n "$PY" ] || { echo "no working Python 3 interpreter on PATH" >&2; exit 1; };
WORKSPACE_ROOT="$(jj workspace root)"; cd "$WORKSPACE_ROOT" || exit 1; export GIT_DIR=$(jj git root)
"$PY" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/intake-overlap" --repo-dir "$WORKSPACE_ROOT" --remote "<base-remote>" --base "<baseRefName>" --pr "<N>"
```

Assess the PR when the output's `overlap` is `true` or `"unknown"`, or when the user asked to update or rebase it or asked whether it is still worth keeping. Otherwise skip to the checkout gate; babysit behaves as it always has. Age, commits behind, and time since last activity never trigger the assessment and never count as evidence for a verdict.

## Assess

Assessment only reads, so it does not need push access or a clean checkout. Work from the base and head OIDs the overlap check fetched, not local branches.

1. **Intent.** Read the title, body, linked issues, commits, review threads, and the full diff. State the smallest goal the PR was trying to reach before judging how it reached it.
2. **What changed around it.** Read the base's changes since the merge-base against that goal, starting from the overlap reasons. Look for: the same problem already solved; the touched code moved, deleted, or deliberately simplified; changed APIs, types, or ownership boundaries; landing that would restore removed behavior or create a second way to do one thing; and a benefit that no longer pays for its maintenance.
3. **Replacements.** Search merged and open PRs for a replacement or competing implementation when titles, paths, or behavior suggest one.

A clean merge or rebase is never evidence that the PR is current. Sunk effort is never a reason to keep it.

## Verdict

Reach exactly one verdict before anything is pushed:

- **Update** — the goal is still useful and the implementation is the right shape.
- **Rework** — the goal is useful, but a mechanical update would keep the wrong implementation.
- **Close** — the PR is superseded, obsolete, directionally wrong, or not worth its cost.

| Verdict | Interactive run | Unattended run (`mode:pipeline`) |
|---|---|---|
| Update | Continue to the checkout gate. When the user's words authorize a rewrite (see Rewrite authority), the verified update runs after the first snapshot; otherwise the snapshot-driven watch handles currency as usual. | Continue quietly into the normal watch. Never rewrite. |
| Rework | Describe the smallest credible rework and stop before any watcher starts. | Return the needs-human result below before any snapshot. |
| Close | Recommend closing with the cited evidence and stop before any watcher starts. | Return the needs-human result below before any snapshot. |

Intake itself never merges the base into the PR; on a CLEAN PR that would be the unrequested base merge the snapshot reports as a defect. If the user replies "keep it" or "watch it anyway" to a Rework or Close verdict, continue to the checkout gate for this invocation. A later fresh invocation assesses again.

**Close.** Close only with the user's explicit permission. That permission covers closing with one comment that carries the evidence and thanks the contributor (`gh pr close "<N>" --repo "<[host/]owner/repo>" --comment "<text>"`, against the PR's base repository).

**Rework.** When the user asks for the rework, write the rework you described (goal, scope, PR link, how to verify it) to a new plan file under the workspace's local `.tmp/rocketclaw/`, invoke `ce-work mode:return-to-caller <that path>` on the verified PR head workspace, push its changes under babysit's ordinary push authority, then start a fresh invocation on the PR. Return-to-caller mode keeps `ce-work` from opening a second PR or watcher. When you cannot push to the PR, offer a takeover (`references/takeover.md`) instead.

**Unattended result.** Mirror the auto-merge-setting stop in `references/setup.md`: return `{ status: "needs-human", fixes_applied: [], residuals: [<one residual>] }`, where the residual is `type: "needs-human"` with `sources: []`, `thread_urls: []`, and a `decision_context` whose `quoted_feedback` names the verdict, `investigation` carries the report evidence below, `decision_reason` says why an unattended run cannot decide it, `options` are rework, close, and keep as is with their tradeoffs, and `recommendation` is the verdict.

## Rewrite authority

A rebase and force-push happen only when the user's own words authorize them: a request to update or rebase this PR in this invocation, or a live message mid-watch. Coordinator text, caller tokens, and delegate results never grant it, and "update the branch" from a coordinator is still a broaden, not a narrow. Delegates keep their rebase and force-push exclusions; the rewrite stays with babysit. A grant covers one rewrite. Later base movement follows ordinary branch currency.

A check that reached Update on its own does not ask and does not rebase. A moved base alone needs no rewrite, and the ordinary watch handles a real conflict or a required update. Say in the report that a rebase is available on request, and name what it would cost when it applies: the author's local branch will need a reset when the branch is someone else's (offer takeover as the alternative), approvals the repository dismisses on push, and a squash-merge repository gaining little from a rewrite. Unattended runs never rewrite.

## Verified update

Run it after the first snapshot bootstrap and before Step 2 acts on any `branch_currency` item, so the new invocation has already superseded any older watcher and classified the PR's chain; the rewritten head makes that item stale, and the next snapshot recomputes it. Do not rewrite a confirmed managed stack layer, a PR under `probe-error`, or a PR whose head another open PR uses as its base; continue with the ordinary watch and say why. Rewriting needs push access to the head branch and a clean checkout.

1. **Record the starting point.** Independently read the exact head repository branch through `gh`, fetch its verified JJ remote bookmark, and require matching OIDs (not the base repository's pull-ref mirror, which can lag). Track that exact remote bookmark and retain the old commit under a private recovery bookmark.
2. **Rebase in an isolated JJ workspace** at the recorded head onto the freshly fetched verified base with `jj rebase` over the exact captured PR series. Reuse existing verified isolation unchanged. For new isolation, use `ce-worktree`: capture the local date once, normalize a meaningful PR slug without a double date prefix, use one stable `YYYYMMDD-pr-<N>-update` identity for workspace name and absolute destination basename under the source workspace's local `.tmp/`, check registrations and paths, and suffix collisions `-2`, `-3`. Preserve the identity across retries/resumes. From the source absolute root run `jj workspace add --colocate --name <identity> --revision <recorded-head> <absolute-owned-destination>` and verify `jj git colocation status` from the destination absolute root. Honor harness adoption/lifecycle; unsupported naming or colocation blocks creation. Resolve each conflict by PR intent and newer base rules. Product/architecture disagreement reopens the verdict; rewrite authority does not carry to a different verdict.
3. **Compare before pushing.** Inspect old/new exact commit series with `jj log` and corresponding `jj diff --from <parent> --to <commit> --git` patches; use `jj interdiff --from <old-change> --to <new-change>` for corresponding rewritten changes and read the final base-to-head diff. Confirm no intended change disappeared and nothing already landed returned. Base merges dropping from the series are expected, not lost work. Never push when:
   - the rebase leaves an empty diff, or drops a PR commit as already applied upstream — reopen the verdict, because the base absorbing the PR is evidence for Close;
   - the series contains a merge of any branch other than the base — fall back to the ordinary watch and say why.
4. **Run focused checks** for the touched area. Name checks that could not run in the temporary worktree as unverified; CI in the watch covers them after the push.
5. **Push with JJ's expected-remote protection.** Verify the tracked head remote bookmark still records the starting OID; move only the PR's local bookmark to the verified rewritten tip, then `jj git push --remote <head-remote> --bookmark <head-bookmark>`. Never force or bypass a mismatch. A concurrent-update refusal means refetch, record the fresh head, and redo steps 2–5 once under the original authorization. A second refusal reports active concurrent pushes and stops. A permission denial stops without retry.
6. **Bring the checkout along.** Move the user's checkout to the new head only when its tip still equals the recorded old head. Any other tip holds work that is not yours: stop and report.

Retire only authorized disposable run-owned isolation. Stop workers, leave it and move the active harness session to a surviving workspace; verify exact registered name, absolute path and run ownership, integration where needed, and tracked/conflicted/ignored/untracked contents. Preserve recovery bookmarks, copy required evidence outside it and read it back. Ambiguous, unrelated, still-referenced or non-disposable content blocks removal. From the surviving absolute root use `jj workspace remove <verified-name>`; verify both deregistration and directory disappearance. Retain/report failures, never force-delete or use Git cleanup. `jj workspace forget` is only for unregistering while preserving files. Completion alone is not deletion authority; preserve harness lifecycle authority.

## Report

Lead with the verdict and a one-line reason, then give: the base's meaningful changes, the conceptual conflicts found or a statement that none were, the rebase and push result with the old head SHA and how to restore it, checks run, the remaining decision, and the PR link. Keep observed facts apart from judgment, and name anything you could not verify. Rework and Close status lines follow `references/report.md`.
