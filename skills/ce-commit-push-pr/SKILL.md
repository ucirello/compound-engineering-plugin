# JJ Commit, Push, and PR

Run all repository commands with cwd set to the target workspace's absolute root (`jj workspace root`). For every repository-scoped `gh` call, obtain and export `GIT_DIR=$(jj git root)` there first; this applies to every reference, example, and retry. Use local `.tmp/` for all temporary, fallback, and error files; outside a JJ repository use local `.tmp/`. Ensure `.tmp/` is ignored. JJ documentation: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/git-experts/ and https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/cli-reference/ .

Before any message composition, read `references/message-standards.md` in full and perform its runtime full-guide and several-subjects-and-bodies comparison. Its strongest instruction and verbatim source excerpts govern all composition steps and references; repository-local syntax always wins.

**Asking the user:** use the host's blocking question tool already in the current tool list (match by capability, not by a host-specific name). Presence in the current tool list is proof the tool exists; never call a user-facing question tool to discover whether it exists. If a matching tool is listed but unloaded, use the host's tool-discovery primitive to load that capability — do not search for another host's tool name. Fall back to asking in chat only when no such tool is in the list or a real question call errors, and never silently skip the question.

## Mode

- **Description-only** — the user wants *just* a description ("write/draft a PR description", "describe this PR", a pasted PR URL or number). Run Step 4 only and print it. Apply it only if asked. Pass any pasted PR ref so Pre-A resolves the range.
- **Description update** — refresh or rewrite an existing PR's description, with no commit or push intent. Resolve PR presence by the Context rule below: an exit-0 `[]` is "no open PR" (report it and stop), and a non-zero exit is **unknown** (resolve auth or connectivity, then stop until presence is known). **With an open PR**, run Step 4 in PR mode on that URL, then Step 5 to preview, confirm, and apply via `gh pr edit`.
- **Full workflow** — otherwise: Steps 1-5. Enter **Stack mode** instead when intent or preference wants a stack.

**`mode:pipeline` modifier**, set by orchestrated callers such as `lfg`. Run the resolved mode non-interactively and suppress every blocking ask. Each suppressed ask takes the conservative default: no existing-PR rewrite, the branch kept, an unresolvable base stopping rather than guessed, and a description-update preview applied directly, since that invocation is the apply intent. Pipeline stack mode uses only the intent and scope on the invocation and passes posture into the handoff.

## Stack mode (opt-in)

**Opt-in only.** Enter it when intent or standing preference wants a multi-PR stack. An explicit stack request is **required intent** — do not re-read it as a single PR with a custom `--base`. **Do not** proactively suggest PR stacks. When the user did **not** ask for one, **refuse** nonsense stacks (one logical change, artificial slices) and stay single-PR.

In stack mode, load `references/stack-submit.md` **before Step 3** and follow only its probing, topology, and retrospective construction; that layer-by-layer commit flow replaces ordinary Step 3. **Do not submit there.** Step 5 handles submission, the `gh stack` CLI dependency and residuals, and the handoff posture: `posture:stack-ready` by default, `posture:stack-land` only on explicit land intent, from the **bottom open non-draft** PR. Do not add `posture:` to this skill's argument-hint.

## Context

**Read `references/context.md` before Step 1.** It defines the command table, exit-code meanings, fork and bookmark traps, and bookmark and PR resolution. Never ask whether to create a feature bookmark when none exists or the default bookmark has work; with no feature work, report and stop. Resolve message syntax at runtime through `references/message-standards.md`, never a fixed type default.

Three rules govern the run.

**Every probe has its exit status interpreted as control flow.** Use argv calls with absolute workspace cwd and `GIT_DIR` in the environment for `gh`, or a shell with the explicit preamble above.

**Probe output is a snapshot.** Re-verify branch, remote, and PR state right before each consequential action: Step 3's push, Step 5's create.

**Only an exit-0 `[]` from a query against the base repo means "no open PR."** A non-zero exit is **unknown**, never "none". On a fork checkout, target the base with `-R` and pass the branch name only, since `--head <owner>:<branch>` silently returns `[]`. With results, do **not** blindly take index 0: match head owner and branch, and stop on an ambiguous match. Note the URL and body from that entry — Step 5 uses the URL to pick the existing-PR path, Step 4 rewrites the existing body.

## Artifact Root

Resolve `<root>` once when archival is on: it writes an explainer under `<root>/explainers/`.

<!-- ce-docs-root:start -->
**Resolve the artifact root `<root>` before composing any artifact path.**

- **Read** `docs_root` from `<repo-root>/.rocketclaw/config.yaml` only (`<repo-root>` = `jj workspace root`). Do not read it from `config.local.yaml`. Unset -> `<root>` is `docs`, exactly as before.
- **Validate** a set value: a repo-relative directory whose real, symlink-resolved path stays inside the repo and is neither the repo root nor under `.git/`. Otherwise stop with an error naming `docs_root` and the value -- never fall back to `docs`.
- **Use** `<root>` as the sole artifact location: create it if absent, compose each path as `<root>/<subdir>` with this skill's own subdirectory, and never also read `docs`.
<!-- ce-docs-root:end -->

## Step 3: Commit and push

**Read `references/commit-and-push.md`** for commit/push mechanics and default-branch handling via `references/branch-creation.md`. If stack mode committed its layers, skip to Step 4; Step 5 submits them.

**Project publishing gate.** Before publishing commits, resolve every applicable pre-push or review-ready requirement from the project's active instructions and conventions already in context and any additional scoped instructions governing the committed paths. Only evidence valid for the exact commit state being sent satisfies them; otherwise stop before the external write and report what is missing or failing. If none, proceed.

Name files in `jj commit` so unrelated working-copy changes stay out. Honor `exclude:<paths>`: leave and report them.

## Step 4: Compose the PR title and body

**You MUST read `references/pr-description-writing.md`** in full — it defines title and body content rules, including preservation of existing `Related:` / `Fixes` on rewrite. Then read **`references/compose.md`** for evidence and teaching decisions: `pr_teaching_section` defaults **on**, `pr_teaching_archive` defaults **off**, and only an active (non-commented) key changes either. Do not add creator, model, harness, or branding attribution.

If Step 1 found an existing PR, pass its URL to Step 4 so PR mode fetches the existing body.

## Step 5: Apply and report

**Read `references/apply-and-handoff.md`** for apply, preview, archival, and handoff. Before `gh pr create`, re-check PR presence: a matching PR takes the existing-PR path, exit-0 `[]` creates, non-zero blocks. Pass the body via `--body-file <path>`, never stdin — `gh` exits 0 with an empty body.

**Completion is decided here.** An interactive full workflow or pipeline stack submit is **not done** until `ce-babysit-pr` owns follow-on for the published PR. Reporting the PR URL alone is not success. Load the callee to choose the monitoring mode. If running it in this session, continue until its stop condition permits a final report.

Only `babysit:off`, config's `auto_babysit: false`, or a "Do not fire" case in `references/apply-and-handoff.md` skips it. No other watch substitutes: not `ci-watcher`, not `gh pr checks --watch`, not a hand-rolled poll, not "later". If `ce-babysit-pr` cannot be loaded or started, stop and report it blocked.

## Message composition standard

"Based on https://go.dev/wiki/CommitMessage and on past commit messages that you can see in `git log`, compose commit messages adherent to the present standards."

Before composing, read the full Go guide at runtime and compare several recent subjects AND bodies with `(cd "$workspace_root" && GIT_DIR=$(jj git root) git log -10 --format=%B)`, from the absolute target workspace root. Compare prefixes/package names, casing, verb tense, subject/body separation, wrapping, and issue placement. Repository-local instructions and observed syntax ALWAYS win; apply compatible Go guidance within that pattern. Without history, use explicit project/user instructions and Go guidance without inventing precedent. The following is verbatim source guidance, not a mandatory repository template:

> Commit messages, also known as CL (changelist) descriptions, should be formatted per https://go.dev/doc/contribute#commit_messages. For example,

```text
net/http: handle foo when bar

[longer description here in the body]

Fixes #12345
```

> Notably, for the subject (the first line of description):
> - the name of the package affected by the change goes before the colon
> - the part after the colon uses the verb tense + phrase that completes the blank in, “this change modifies Go to **___**”
> - the verb after the colon is lowercase
> - there is no trailing period
> - it should be kept as short as possible (many git viewing tools prefer under ~72 characters, though Go isn’t super strict about this).

> For the body (the rest of the description):
> - the text should be wrapped to ~72 characters (to appease git viewing tools, mainly), unless you really need longer lines (e.g. for ASCII art, tables, or long links).
> - the Fixes line goes after the body with a blank newline separating the two. (It is acceptable but not required to use a trailing period, such as Fixes #12345.).
> - there is no Markdown in the commit message.
> - similarly, we do not use Co-authored-by and Assisted-by lines. Don’t add them.
