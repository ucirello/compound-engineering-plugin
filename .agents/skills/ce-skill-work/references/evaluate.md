# Validating a skill change

Mechanical contracts (frontmatter, paths, greppable invariants, parity, script behavior) go in `bun test` and run in CI. Prose behavior — routing judgment, restraint, cross-model outcomes — is evaluated with a model and is best-effort evidence, not a CI job. Read the guide's "Evaluate proportionally" section for sizing.

## When an eval is required

Any change to how a skill routes, what it asks, when it stops, what it commits or publishes, or how it degrades — on any harness. A pure removal still needs one when a removed line had provenance you overrode. Skip for changes that cannot alter behavior (typo, path, formatting) and say so. When the eval is required but a capability it needs is unavailable — no fresh-context subagent, or one of the two hosts unreachable — record that as the exact skip reason (which capability, on which host) and finish; run the part that is available (a single-host eval is evidence, labeled as single-host). Convenience is not a capability gap.

## How

Use `skill-creator`'s eval workflow — invoke the `skill-creator` skill through the active harness's skill mechanism; it injects the current skill content from disk into a fresh subagent, so it tests your edit rather than the session-cached copy. The project's active instructions ("Validating Agent and Skill Changes") explain why in-session `Skill`-tool or typed-agent dispatch runs pre-edit content; do not test through those, and do not touch the plugin cache to force a reload.

**Keep the test honest.** A test subagent must not know it is testing a skill: prompt it the way a user would ("use the `<skill>` skill to do X"), pass the raw artifacts (the file, the finding, the diff), never your diagnosis, the intended fix, or the expected answer. Fresh context per pass; clean up anything a run leaves on disk before the next; if a scenario passes only when the agent can see leaked context, tighten the skill or the setup before trusting the result. Read the transcripts, not just the final outputs — a skill that reaches the right answer while spending turns on unproductive steps has a defect the output hides, and several runs independently writing the same helper is a signal to bundle a script.

Baseline, then compare: run the scenario against the pre-change skill first when a behavior is being *changed* (so you can see the failure the change fixes), then against the edited skill. Include a no-guidance control when the question is whether a line does anything at all. Read every result; do not score by keyword.

Cover, proportionally to risk: the path the change touches on the weakest realistic model tier; strong-model regression (did prose make a capable model worse); restraint (does the skill stop where it should, and does it avoid case catalogs, repeated autonomy gates, repeated command skeletons, and blanket brevity slogans); activation (positive, adjacent-negative, explicit invoke) when the description or trigger changed — with substantive prompts, since a trivial one-step ask never triggers a skill regardless of description; and the next consumer's contract when an envelope or handoff changed. Run on Claude and Codex by default — cross-host divergence is the biggest portability risk and the one a single-host run cannot see.

For new CLI-wrapper skills, include a restraint fixture where the tempting output is five or more near-duplicate command blocks sharing the same flags. Passing behavior is one canonical invocation with parameters or named deltas, plus late references only for demonstrated gaps or non-derivable facts.

For new model-invoked skills, include a description-restraint fixture using the single contrast pair in `references/new-skill.md` as the fixture source. Passing behavior is a context pointer: what the skill is with the leading prompt word first, one trigger per genuinely distinct branch in "Use when..." or "Use for..." form, and adjacent negatives only when they block real false-trigger neighbors.

For cross-model output guidance, include a restraint check that the authored skill does not copy a Fable-only brevity block or use a blanket "be concise" / "keep it short" slogan. Passing behavior names the report fields that must survive shortening; for CLI wrappers: command, exit status, output path/size, and stderr or blocker.

**Read the result honestly.** If old and new prose both succeed on a strong model, that is no regression, not improvement — test the claimed insurance at the layer where it matters (the weaker tier or the other harness). Measure the outcome the skill exists to improve, not proxy volume: routing, state, authority, and completion for an orchestrator; claim support for research; clarification burden and execution errors for planning. For a side-effecting skill, grade intended and suppressed actions first, then use fake boundaries or dry-run contracts before anything live.

## Record

In the PR: scenarios, tiers/hosts, what the pre-change run did, what the post-change run did, and anything the eval surfaced that you did not act on. Authored scenario sets over-represent the happy path; add one scenario from a real failure (a bot finding, a session that went wrong) whenever you have one. Improve from what generalizes across scenarios, not from what fixes one — a skill tuned to its handful of eval cases is overfit.
