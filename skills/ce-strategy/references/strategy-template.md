# Strategy Template

Loaded by `SKILL.md` after the interview is complete. Fill it in using the captured answers and write to `<workspace-root>/STRATEGY.md` as resolved there.

## Rules for filling in

- Use the user's own language where possible. Do not paraphrase into generic PM-speak.
- Each section stays compact. The whole doc should read in under 5 minutes.
- Write the sections below in this order. Sections you did not write — added by the user or another skill — are preserved as found and stay where they are; do not add sections of your own beyond this template.
- Optional sections (Milestones, Brand): delete entirely if unused. Do not leave empty headers. Boundaries is always present.
- Set `last_updated` in the YAML frontmatter to today's ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD). Do not duplicate the date in prose.
- Set `name` in the frontmatter to the product or initiative name (the same value used in the H1 title).

## Template

The block below is the literal file to write (minus this line and the fences). Replace every `{{placeholder}}` with the captured answer. Delete any optional section whose placeholder wasn't answered.

name: {{product_name}}
last_updated: {{YYYY-MM-DD}}

# {{product_name}} Strategy

{{If a sibling product doc exists at the workspace root - VISION.md, PRODUCT.md - one line here pointing to it, e.g. "See VISION.md for the project's north star; this document carries direction." Then do not restate what that doc already says: where a section below would repeat it, keep this doc's section to what is specific to strategy and defer to the sibling for the rest. Omit the line when no sibling exists.}}

## Purpose

{{1-2 sentence diagnosis. Names the user situation and the crux that makes it hard, and so why the product exists. No solution language.}}

## Positioning

{{1-2 sentence guiding policy. The choice this product commits to that a neighboring product could not truthfully claim, so that the purpose becomes tractable.}}

## Users

**Primary:** {{Persona name}} - {{one-sentence JTBD, e.g. "They're hiring {{product_name}} to..."}}

<!-- Duplicate the block above for additional personas only if truly necessary. Fewer is better. -->

## Key metrics

- **{{metric 1 name}}** - {{one-line definition; where it's measured}}
- **{{metric 2 name}}** - {{...}}
- **{{metric 3 name}}** - {{...}}

<!-- 3-5 total. Stop at 5. -->

## Tracks

### {{Track 1 name}}

{{One line: what this track is - the investment area, not a feature list.}}

_Why it serves the approach:_ {{one line}}

<!-- Duplicate the block above for 2-4 tracks total. If you can't keep it to 4, something is wrong - fold related tracks together. -->

## Boundaries

- {{one line per item the team is tempted by and has decided against; "Nothing named yet." if none}}

_Resist a change when:_ {{one line, from the proposals the user resisted in the stress test; omit the line if none}}

<!-- Always present. Things the team keeps being tempted by, plus the resist test. Not a blocker list. -->

## Milestones

- **{{YYYY-MM-DD}}** - {{milestone}}

<!-- Optional. Delete the section if unused. Only externally visible milestones: launches, fundraises, conferences, renewals. -->

## Brand

**One-liner:** {{single-sentence pitch}}

**Key message:** {{2-3 lines if useful}}

<!-- Optional. Delete the section if unused. -->

## Post-write checklist

Before confirming the write, scan the draft for:

- [ ] Frontmatter present at the top with `name` and `last_updated` keys.
- [ ] `last_updated` carries today's date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).
- [ ] No section has more than 4 sentences except Tracks (where each track has its own short block).
- [ ] No placeholders remain (`{{...}}`).
- [ ] Optional sections (Milestones, Brand) with no content have been deleted, not left empty; Boundaries is present.
- [ ] Sections this skill did not write are unchanged and still in place.
- [ ] Metric count is between 3 and 5. Track count is between 2 and 4.
- [ ] Purpose and Positioning are connected - one clearly responds to the other.
