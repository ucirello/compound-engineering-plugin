# `ce-babysit-pr`

> Watch an open GitHub PR and keep it moving toward merge-ready. Report when it *looks* ready. Land only if you asked.

`ce-babysit-pr` is the **post-open watch**. It is a git-workflow skill, not a core-loop step. After `/ce-commit-push-pr` opens a PR, this skill watches three streams (review comments, CI, base-branch movement) until the PR looks ready, is blocked, hits a budget, or is merged/closed.

It is a conductor. It does **not** fix comments or diagnose CI itself. Comments go to `/ce-resolve-pr-feedback`. Real CI failures go to `/ce-debug`. This skill owns the loop, the order, dedup across ticks, the settle window, bounded branch maintenance, and the stop.

That is the contrast with `/ce-resolve-pr-feedback`, which is a one-pass "fix the comments now" skill. Use that when you want a single round you watch. Use this when you want the PR driven over time.

**Posture** sets the scope. Default is `target` (the named PR only). On a confirmed managed stack you can choose `stack-ready` (advance upstack after settle, no merge) or `stack-land` (same walk, plus `gh stack merge` of the bottom-most open settled prefix). **Settled is not merged.** A layer can look ready and still be OPEN.

It cannot promise merge-readiness. A reviewer can still comment later. Required checks can change. Under `target` and `stack-ready`, you merge. Selecting `stack-land` *is* land authorization for that managed prefix.

GitHub only, including GitHub Enterprise that `gh` is configured for.

## TL;DR

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What does it do? | Watches an open PR (or a confirmed managed stack) and reacts to comments, CI, and base movement |
| When to use it | A PR is open and you want it driven toward merge without handling each round yourself |
| What it produces | Delegated comment and CI fixes, surfaced `needs-human` items, optional stack-layer moves, and an outcome-first summary |
| How it works | Delegates comments to `/ce-resolve-pr-feedback` and CI to `/ce-debug`. Owns the loop, posture, and stop. |
| Modes | In-session watch (default) or Checkpoint. Postures: `target` / `stack-ready` / `stack-land`. |

---

## Example invocations

Empty invoke watches the current branch's PR. A number or URL pins the PR. `watch` / `checkpoint` force the loop style. `posture:` is separate from that.

```text
# Current branch's PR. In-session watch if the harness can wake you; else one checkpoint tick.
/ce-babysit-pr

# Named PR
/ce-babysit-pr 1234
/ce-babysit-pr https://github.com/acme/widgets/pull/1234

# One tick, persist, print the exact resume command. Monitoring is paused.
/ce-babysit-pr 1234 checkpoint

# Force the in-session watch even if the harness would have picked checkpoint
/ce-babysit-pr 1234 watch

# Cap the active-time budget (default is 8 hours of active watch time)
/ce-babysit-pr 1234 2 hours

# Confirmed managed stack: after settle, continue upstack. Do not merge.
/ce-babysit-pr posture:stack-ready

# Same walk, and land the settled prefix when green
/ce-babysit-pr posture:stack-land
```

For a single pass over comments you want to watch yourself, use `/ce-resolve-pr-feedback` instead.

## The Problem

Hand-babysitting, or a naive loop, usually fails in the same ways:

- Wait for the whole CI run, *then* read comments. A comment fix pushes and retriggers CI, so that wait burned a cycle
- CI goes green, the loop says ready, and review lands after
- The watcher reimplements feedback resolution and CI debugging, then drifts from those skills
- An in-session `sleep` loop cannot run in a sandboxed GUI harness, and Claude Code blocks foreground `sleep`
- The run stops and you cannot tell what it did, or you get a wall of per-thread receipts

## The Solution

Each tick is stateless and resumable from disk. The harness only has to wake the agent when something changed.

- **Comments first.** New review threads and non-thread comments are handled before CI. After that pass, if a commit was pushed, the old CI failure is against a dead SHA and is skipped
- **Delegation.** `/ce-resolve-pr-feedback` for comments, `/ce-debug` for real failures (once per new signature). The only inline CI work is a cheap flaky-vs-real split
- **Bounded branch currency.** A PR that falls behind its normal base can be updated only when the result mechanically preserves the PR's intent. A disputable conflict becomes a sticky `needs-human`
- **Settle window.** "Looks ready" needs GitHub `CLEAN`, no open feedback, no parked `needs-human`, and enough quiet time. A started-but-unfinished review waits at least 15 quiet minutes and at most 30
- **In-session watch by default.** `pr-snapshot watch` polls with no agent tokens and prints `BABYSIT_WAKE` only on an actionable change. If the harness cannot background-and-wake, the skill runs one checkpoint tick and prints the resume command
- **Posture for confirmed managed stacks.** `target` stops at the named PR. `stack-ready` continues upstack without merging. `stack-land` continues and lands the settled prefix

A `needs-human` item blocks the ready call. It does **not** end the watch. New comments and CI still get handled.

---

## What Makes It Novel

### Comments before CI, then drop the stale SHA

Within a tick: terminal check, then comments, then re-check the head SHA, then CI only if that SHA did not move. A CI fix is never applied against a pre-comment commit.

The same rule applies to an in-progress review (an 👀 or a "reviewing…" note). Already-posted comments are handled immediately. The signal only withholds the "looks ready" call.

### One tick, any driver

State lives under `/tmp/compound-engineering-<effective-uid>/ce-babysit-pr/<host>-<owner>-<repo>-<pr>/` (under `$TMPDIR/compound-engineering-<effective-uid>/` instead when `/tmp` cannot host a writable private root, as in a sandbox that only allowlists `$TMPDIR`). A later invoke, a checkpoint resume, or a durable scheduler all drive the same tick. That is why the skill can run in a CLI session or fall back in a GUI harness that cannot keep a background wait.

Default budget is **8 hours of active watch time** (laptop-sleep gaps are excluded). A **3-calendar-day** wall-clock backstop caps every run. You can pass a shorter duration at invoke.

### Looks ready is a cooling-off judgment

Ready is not "CI is green." GitHub must report the PR mergeable against the current base, the attention set must be empty, and the quiet window (default 5 minutes when no review signal was seen) must have elapsed. An incomplete review lifecycle uses the 15 / 30 minute bounds above. Even then the summary says "looks ready, your call" or "cautiously looks ready."

When a fork PR's CI is waiting on maintainer approval, the skill drains review for a bounded window (5, 15, or 30 minutes) and then hands back. It never approves the workflow run. Pipeline mode returns that blocker immediately.

### Posture is a run value, not a keyword guess

Only a fresh probe with `manager_status == "confirmed"` activates stack-wide continuation. A manual base/head chain never does.

| Posture | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `target` | Named PR only. Stop at looks-ready. May offer once to continue upstack. Never merges. |
| `stack-ready` | After settle, continue to the next open non-draft layer that needs work. Never merges. |
| `stack-land` | Like `stack-ready`, plus `gh stack merge` of the bottom-most open settled PR, then `gh stack sync`. |

A just-landed `MERGED` under `stack-land` is a layer transition, not the end of the whole run.

## Quick Example

`/ce-commit-push-pr` opens PR #1234 and hands off. `/ce-babysit-pr` confirms GitHub, checks out the PR head, and starts `pr-snapshot watch`.

A review bot posts three inline threads while CI is still running. The next tick sends them to `/ce-resolve-pr-feedback`, which fixes two and parks one as `needs-human`. That push invalidates the in-flight CI SHA, so the skill does not debug the old failure.

New CI comes back red on a real test. `/ce-debug` fixes and pushes. Base moves; the PR is `BEHIND`. Host branch-update succeeds because the merge is mechanical.

The parked thread still blocks "ready." A reviewer answers it. The next tick resolves the rest, waits out the settle window, and reports looks-ready. You merge.

## When to Reach For It

Use `ce-babysit-pr` when:

- A PR is open and you want it driven toward merge without handling each round
- You are about to context-switch and still want comments and CI handled
- `/ce-commit-push-pr` just opened a PR (handoff is the default)
- You own a confirmed managed stack and want `stack-ready` or `stack-land`

Skip it when:

- The remote is not GitHub (GitLab, Bitbucket). The skill stops up front rather than half-running
- No PR exists, or the PR is already merged or closed
- An automatic handoff landed on a draft. A direct invoke that resolves to that draft is fine; `watch` / `checkpoint` also arms it
- You want to approve each fix before it is pushed -> `/ce-resolve-pr-feedback` one pass at a time
- The only issue is one known bug -> `/ce-debug`

---

## Chain Position

On-demand, after a PR exists.

```text
/ce-work  ->  /ce-commit-push-pr  ->  /ce-babysit-pr
                                       |-- new comments -> /ce-resolve-pr-feedback
                                       |-- real CI      -> /ce-debug
                                       |-- base moved   -> bounded branch maintenance
```

Use `/ce-resolve-pr-feedback` directly when you want one manual pass. Use this skill when you want that pass (and CI, and base movement) repeated until ready.

## Use Standalone

- Current branch: `/ce-babysit-pr`
- Specific PR: `/ce-babysit-pr 1234` or a URL
- One tick: `/ce-babysit-pr 1234 checkpoint`
- Stack: `/ce-babysit-pr posture:stack-ready` or `posture:stack-land`

---

## Reference

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| _(empty)_ | Current branch's PR. Mode from harness capability. Posture `target`. |
| `<PR number or URL>` | That PR |
| `watch` / `checkpoint` | Force the execution mode |
| `<duration>` | Active-time budget (default 8 hours). Example: `2 hours`. |
| `posture:target\|stack-ready\|stack-land` | Run scope on a confirmed managed stack |
| `mode:pipeline` | Bounded synchronous ticks for an orchestrator. No settle wait. Structured return. |

`scripts/pr-snapshot` is the snapshot and state helper: it paginates review threads, records CI and branch currency, and emits the per-tick attention set. Its `watch` subcommand is the token-free change detector. A newer successful invoke takes ownership; older wakes are stale hints. Details live in the skill's `references/watch-loop.md`.

## FAQ

**Does it merge the PR?**
Under `target` and `stack-ready`, no. It tells you when the PR *looks* ready. For a managed stack it prints the exact `gh stack merge` command when ready-as-next. Under `stack-land`, that posture authorizes landing the bottom-most open settled prefix via `gh stack merge` + sync.

**Why not wait for CI, then handle comments?**
A comment fix pushes and retriggers CI. Handling comments during the run collapses the two timelines.

**How does it avoid "green, then surprise review"?**
It never calls ready on one green snapshot. It needs `CLEAN`, an empty attention set, and a settle window. A started review gets 15 to 30 quiet minutes. Late activity resets the clock. The wording stays "looks ready, your call."

**Does it run forever in the background?**
The default is an in-session watch: a token-free detector wakes the agent only when something changed. Close the session and re-invoke to resume from disk. For a multi-day unattended watch, use a durable scheduler (or cron running the resume command). It never fakes a loop with foreground `sleep`.

**Does it fix CI itself?**
It classifies (flaky -> one rerun; real -> `/ce-debug`) and delegates. Comments go to `/ce-resolve-pr-feedback`.

**What about merge conflicts?**
It previews the exact observed base first. It completes a merge only when every conflict has one mechanical answer that preserves the PR's intent, and when push authority to that head is known. Otherwise it parks a `needs-human`. It never rebases or force-pushes. Managed stacks stay on the manager's restack path.

**What happens when the base keeps moving?**
Each distinct head/base/status observation has a bounded claim-and-confirm cycle. Routine movement can be applied many times. The same unchanged observation is not retried across restarts. A parked semantic conflict stays parked when later base commits do not change the conflict.
