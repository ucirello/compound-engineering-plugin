# `ce-ideate`

> When you don't yet have an idea, get a ranked set of grounded directions you can pick from, discuss, or discard.

`ce-ideate` is the optional **discovery** step. Use it when the question is "which directions are worth exploring?" not "help me refine this one I already have." It grounds first (the repo, past learnings, prior art on the web, and optionally Slack or your issue tracker), generates candidates from six frames, and keeps only the ones that survive an adversarial cut. Every survivor carries a tagged **basis** you can check. Rejected ideas come with reasons.

It works on software in this repo, on a product outside the repo, and on topics with no software surface (names, narrative, personal decisions, business strategy). The generate-then-critique engine and the basis rule stay the same.

This is the first step in the compound-engineering ideation chain. Skip it when you already know what to explore:

```text
/ce-ideate         /ce-brainstorm      /ce-plan             /ce-work
"What's worth      "What does this     "What's needed       "Build it."
 exploring?"        need to be?"        to accomplish
                                        this?"
```

Acting on a survivor goes to `ce-brainstorm`. In a repo, do not skip from ideation to `ce-plan`. Outside a software build, the saved idea set can be the end of the run.

If the options are already on the table and you need a verdict, use `ce-pov` instead.

## TL;DR

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What does it do? | Grounds in real material, splits the topic into axes, generates candidates across six frames, critiques them, and presents 5-7 survivors, each with a tagged basis |
| When to use it | You don't have a specific idea yet: greenfield, a codebase audit, issue-tracker mining, surprise-me, naming, a decision, a strategy question |
| What it produces | A ranked ideation file, HTML by default (openable in a browser). `output:md` writes markdown. Lands in `docs/ideation/` when that tree exists, otherwise a temp path under `/tmp/compound-engineering-<effective-uid>/` |
| What's next | `ce-brainstorm` on one survivor, stay here and discuss or refine the set, or keep the file and stop |

## Example invocations

```text
# Generate grounded product or codebase opportunities
/ce-ideate what should we improve in this repository?

# Focus ideation on a specific product surface
/ce-ideate onboarding improvements for new team administrators

# Find solution opportunities across patterns in open GitHub issues
/ce-ideate what product opportunities do you see across our open GitHub issues?

# Ideate from the open work in an accessible Linear project
/ce-ideate find solution opportunities across https://linear.app/acme/project/customer-onboarding-1234

# Ask for non-obvious directions without naming a subject
/ce-ideate surprise me

# Use the same engine for non-software ideation
/ce-ideate names for a neighborhood coffee shop

# Ask for Markdown instead of the default self-contained HTML artifact
/ce-ideate developer experience improvements, and write the artifact in Markdown

# Equivalent shorthand when a repeatable automation needs it
/ce-ideate developer experience improvements output:md
```

Use `ce-pov` when the candidates are already known and need judgment. Use `ce-brainstorm` when one candidate needs scope.

## The Problem

Asking an AI "what's worth exploring here?" usually returns:

- Plausible bullets with no grounding in the actual subject
- The first few obvious frames and nothing else
- A flat list with no signal about which directions are strong
- No record of what was considered and rejected
- Claims that sound confident and cite nothing

## The Solution

`ce-ideate` separates grounding, generation, critique, and selection. Quality comes from explicit rejection with reasons, not optimistic ranking.

- Grounding agents go first: codebase scan (in a repo), past learnings, web prior art, optional Slack and issue intelligence
- The topic is split into 3-5 axes from that grounding: *what* to cover, separate from *how* to think
- Six frames generate in parallel, each spreading ideas across those axes
- Every idea carries a tagged basis: `direct:`, `external:`, or `reasoned:`
- Ideas without a basis are dropped
- Survivors are scored and shown with downsides and confidence
- A rejection summary shows what was cut and why

## What Makes It Novel

### 1. Grounding before any idea is generated

Every run starts with parallel grounding: the codebase (in repo mode), `docs/solutions/`, web prior art, and optional Slack or issue intelligence. In a repo, cheap evidence scouts then pull verbatim quotes with `file:line` pointers so later ideas cite real code. Web prior art is the piece that stops the run from remixing only what's already in the repo or in your head.

You can also point the prompt at your own research (a survey export, an analytics dump, a social-listening report). A cheap agent distills that into a citable dossier. It adds source classes web research doesn't reach; it does not replace the web pass.

### 2. Every idea cites its evidence

Each survivor carries one tagged basis:

- `direct:` quoted evidence
- `external:` named prior art
- `reasoned:` a written-out first-principles argument, not a gesture

Plausible speculation with no basis is rejected. Grounding without a basis is well-informed speculation. A basis without grounding is clever-sounding rationalization.

### 3. Six frames, then a cut

The frames are pain and friction; inversion, removal, or automation; assumption-breaking; leverage and compounding; cross-domain analogy; and constraint-flipping. One prompt tends to collapse into the model's most-trained directions. Separate frames, especially analogy and constraint-flipping, produce a wider set.

Default software and product runs use five agents to cover all six frames. `go deep` raises the whole fleet to the conversation's top-tier model, doubles verification, and adds a second critic. A tactical ask (`quick wins`, `polish`, `cleanup`) keeps every frame and shrinks volume: fewer ideas per frame, fewer verification reads, at most 3 axes. Issue-tracker runs replace the six frames with the tracker's highest-leverage themes (up to four) when the scan returns usable themes.

Critique is two layers. A verifier that never saw generation tries to refute each candidate: do the quotes exist, is the prior art real, does the argument hold? Then the orchestrator makes the final cut. Every rejection gets a one-line reason.

### 4. Axes so six frames don't all land on the same slice

Frames decide *how* to think. Axes decide *what part* of the topic to think on. Before dispatch, the orchestrator derives 3-5 orthogonal axes from grounding. For social sharing those might be send, discovery, arrival, compounding, and actor types. Each frame spreads ideas across them. If an axis has zero ideas, one bounded recovery dispatch fills it. Atomic topics (a name, a tagline) and surprise-me runs skip this.

### 5. Three modes, plus surprise-me and the issue tracker

The same engine runs on things in this codebase, a software product outside this repo, or a topic with no software surface.

Non-software mode uses a facilitator in the topic's own language. Same six frames, same basis rule, same critique. Depth is Quick (3-5 survivors, one inline round), Standard (5-7, still inline), or Full (5-7, frames dispatched as agents). `ce-brainstorm` on a non-software survivor develops that idea further (a name into a brand brief, a plot into an outline). It is not the first step of a build chain.

`/ce-ideate surprise me` skips naming a subject. Each frame picks its own from the grounding. Combinations across those subjects are expected.

Phrases like "what users are reporting" or "biggest issue patterns" start an issue-intelligence pass against GitHub, Linear, or Jira, whichever is reachable. Large trackers are scoped by the tracker's own structure. The skill asks at most one question, and only when the tracker is genuinely split. It says what it did and did not analyze.

## Quick Example

You invoke `ce-ideate "DX improvements"` from inside a repo. The agent names the grounding and ideation agents it will dispatch and lists the skip phrases (`no external research`, `no slack`).

Grounding returns a codebase summary, relevant learnings, and prior art on developer-experience patterns. The orchestrator splits the topic into axes (feedback loops, environment friction, tooling, knowledge access, automation), then scouts gather a quote-and-pointer dossier per axis. Five agents covering six frames generate candidates from that evidence. The orchestrator merges the list, synthesizes combinations, checks axis coverage, and runs the two-layer critique.

A default run generates on the order of 36-48 raw ideas and keeps 5-7. The session summary looks like `Wrote 7 ranked ideas (36 raw, 13 cut) across 5 axes`.

The full cards (basis, rationale, downsides, confidence, complexity) plus the rejection summary land in a self-contained HTML file that opens in the browser. The session shows a one-line count, a ranked one-liner per survivor, and the path. Then a four-option menu:

1. Open in browser (or Publish to Proof on a markdown run)
2. Brainstorm one idea with `ce-brainstorm`
3. Discuss or refine the ideas first
4. Done: keep the file and stop

Say `discard` if you don't want a file created this run. Discard does not delete a resumed existing doc.

## When to Reach For It

Reach for `ce-ideate` when:

- You don't have a specific idea yet and want a qualified candidate set
- The thinking is greenfield or big-picture
- You want a focus area explored without committing to a direction
- You want a surprising direction (`surprise me`)
- You want to mine the issue tracker for patterns
- The topic is not software at all

Skip `ce-ideate` when:

- You already have a specific feature or decision in mind → `/ce-brainstorm`
- The options are already on the table and you need a verdict → `/ce-pov`
- Requirements are ready and you need execution guardrails → `/ce-plan`
- You're debugging a known bug → `/ce-debug`

## Use as Part of the Chained Workflow

```text
/ce-ideate            "What's worth exploring?"
   |
   |   chosen survivor (with basis + rationale)
   v
/ce-brainstorm        "What does this need to be?"
   |
   |   requirements / brief (R-IDs, A-IDs, F-IDs, AE-IDs in software mode)
   v
/ce-plan              "What's needed to accomplish this?"
   |
   |   structured plan (U-IDs, files, test scenarios: guardrails, not code)
   v
/ce-work              "Build it."
```

Each artifact is input for the next. The survivor's basis becomes the brainstorm's evidence seed. The brainstorm's decisions become the plan's requirements and scope. The plan's U-IDs and test scenarios are the guardrails `ce-work` executes against. When you pick "Brainstorm one idea," `ce-brainstorm` loads with that idea's basis, rationale, and tradeoffs. The ideation file is already saved.

In a repo, acting on an idea always goes to `ce-brainstorm`, not `ce-plan`. `ce-plan` wants a brainstorm-grounded Product Contract.

The chain works outside software too: weekend-trip directions feed a brainstorm that defines the trip, which can feed a plan that structures bookings, packing, and itinerary. In that mode brainstorming is optional deeper development, not a required next rung.

## Use Standalone

`ce-ideate` is a complete ideation cycle on its own. It produces a ranked, reasoned idea set as a saved file you can open, share, brainstorm from, or discard.

**Software:**

- **Codebase audits:** `/ce-ideate "what to improve in this repo"` (pair with `STRATEGY.md` for strategy-aligned weighting)
- **Issue triage:** `/ce-ideate "biggest issue themes in the last quarter"`
- **Pricing or positioning ideation:** `/ce-ideate "pricing page A/B test ideas"`
- **Surprise-me runs:** `/ce-ideate "surprise me"` from inside any repo

**Non-software:**

- **Naming:** coffee shops, baby names, products, brands
- **Personal decisions:** career options, sabbatical destinations
- **Plot or narrative ideation:** short story directions, character beats
- **Business strategy:** go-to-market, positioning against a competitor
- **Travel and events:** trip themes, wedding-venue concepts

The file is written every run. Say `discard` to delete a file created this run.

If a related ideation file from the last 30 days exists, the skill offers to resume it instead of starting a duplicate.

|----------|--------|
| _(empty)_ | Open-ended; asks for a subject or routes to surprise-me |
| `<concept>` | e.g., `DX improvements`, `auth quality` |
| `<path>` | a directory or file to focus on |
| `<constraint>` | e.g., `low-complexity quick wins`, `polish-only` |
| `surprise me` | Surprise-me mode |
| `go deep` | Maximum depth: every ideation agent on the top-tier model, doubled verification, a second critic |
| `top issue themes in <area>` | Triggers issue-tracker intent |
| `top 3` / `100 ideas` / `raise the bar` | Volume override: survivor count, raw total, or a higher bar |
| `output:md` | Write the artifact as markdown instead of the default self-contained HTML (`output:html` forces HTML). Also settable per-project via `ideate_output` in CE config (`config.local.yaml` then `config.yaml`); see the [configuration reference](./configuration.md). Pipeline and `disable-model-invocation` runs force markdown. |

Skip phrases supported anywhere in the prompt: `no external research`, `no slack`.

## FAQ

**Why six frames? Why not just one "give me ideas" prompt?**
One prompt collapses into the model's most-trained directions. Separate frames, especially cross-domain analogy and constraint-flipping, surface ideas a single prompt usually misses.

**Why a basis requirement?**
Without a basis, plausible-sounding ideas pass through unfiltered. Every survivor cites real evidence, real prior art, or a written-out argument. You can audit it.

**Does it work for non-software topics?**
Yes. A facilitator runs the same generate-critique-survive engine in the topic's own language for naming, narrative, personal decisions, and business strategy. Codebase grounding is replaced by user-context synthesis and web research.

**Can I go straight to `ce-plan` from a survivor?**
Not from inside a repo. Acting on an idea loads `ce-brainstorm` with a substance seed. `ce-plan` wants a brainstorm-grounded Product Contract. Outside a software build, the saved idea set can be the end of the run; brainstorming there is optional deeper development of one idea.

**What if I want to tweak or talk through the ideas before committing to a brainstorm?**
Pick "Discuss or refine the ideas first." Stay in `ce-ideate` and work across the set: adjust or interrogate one idea, compare several, or combine them. Adjustments and merges update the saved file; pure Q&A and comparison do not. The file is written automatically, so if you didn't want a new one kept, say `discard`.

**What if my prompt is ambiguous?**
A subject-identification gate asks one scope question when the prompt names only a quality (`improvements`, `quick wins`) rather than a specific thing. "Surprise me" is a real option, not a fallback.
