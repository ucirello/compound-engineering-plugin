  tagline: Compound Engineering is a set of skills for the coding agent you already use. Plan, work, review, then compound. What you learn gets written down where the next run will read it.

  <p>Most of the thinking happens before and after the code is written. The last step is the one that pays off next time.</p>
  <ol class="ce-steps">
    <li><strong>Plan</strong><span>Decide what to build and why before any code exists.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Work</strong><span>Build it from the plan, with tests and review gates along the way.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Review</strong><span>Check the change against the plan and the repo's standards.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Compound</strong><span>Write down what was learned so the next run starts further ahead.</span></li>
