# `ce-commit`

> Make local git commit(s) from the working tree. No push, no PR.

`ce-commit` is a **git-workflow** skill, not a core-loop step. Use it when you want changes saved on the current branch and nothing else. It reads the repo's commit convention, stages files by name, and splits into separate commits when the files fall into distinct concerns.

It is the local-only sibling of `/ce-commit-push-pr`. That skill ships a PR. This one stops after the commit.

## TL;DR

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What does it do? | Commits current work locally, following repo conventions, staging files by name |
| When to use it | "Commit this" or "save my changes" when you do not want a push or a PR |
| What it produces | One commit, or up to three when files split cleanly. Stays on the branch. |
| What's next | `/ce-commit-push-pr` when you want a PR, or `git push` yourself |

## Example invocations

The prompt, if any, is a hint for the subject or the file grouping. There is no mode flag. An empty invoke is the common case.

```text
# Current work, local only. On main or detached HEAD, create a feature branch first.
# Clean tree: report nothing to commit and stop.
/ce-commit

# Steer the subject and which files belong together
/ce-commit commit the auth changes

# Mid-flow save. Same local-only path.
/ce-commit save my changes
```

For commit plus push plus an open PR, use `/ce-commit-push-pr` instead.

## The Problem

A rushed commit often does one of these:

- `git add -A` or `git add .` pulls in `.env` files, build output, generated files, or scratch notes
- The message follows conventional commits in a repo that uses ticket prefixes, or the other way around
- Backend, frontend, and docs land in one commit because splitting felt like extra work
- The subject lists files (`update foo.rb`) instead of the outcome
- The commit lands on a detached HEAD or on the default branch, where it is easy to lose or fights branch protection

## The Solution

`ce-commit` treats commit creation as a short, fixed pass:

- **Convention comes from the repo.** Project instructions already in context win, then a clear pattern in the last 10 commits (conventional commits, ticket prefixes, emoji prefixes), then conventional commits (`type(scope): description`) as the fallback. Under conventional commits, when `fix:` and `feat:` both fit it defaults to `fix:`. You can override.
- **Files are staged by name.** An explicit `git add file1 file2 file3`, never `git add -A` or `git add .`. That keeps credentials, `dist/` output, and untracked notes out of the commit. An `exclude:<paths>` in the invocation keeps those files uncommitted and the report says so.
- **Splits stay at the file boundary.** Two or three distinct concerns become separate commits (a data-layer change in one directory, a UI change in another). `git add -p` is out of scope. When the grouping is unclear, one commit is correct.
- **Unsafe HEAD gets a branch.** On detached HEAD or the default branch, it creates a feature branch from the change content and continues there, without asking. It does not leave the only copy of the work somewhere it can be lost.
- **The subject names the outcome.** Imperative, states what is now possible or fixed. A body appears only when the why is not obvious. When a plan unit ID is already in hand for the commit, it is appended in parentheses (`(U3)` for unit 3).

The message goes to git via a file (`git commit -F`), so quotes, backticks, and multi-line bodies pass through literally with no shell quoting to get wrong.

## Quick Example

You finish a notification-mute change that touches a model, a controller, and a JS component. You invoke `/ce-commit`.

Git status shows four modified files. Recent commits use conventional commits with a scope (`feat(auth): ...`). The branch is `tmchow/notification-mute`, not the default.

Model and controller group as the data layer. The JS component is the UI. Two commits:

```text
feat(notifications): add per-subscription mute_until column

Subscriptions can now carry a mute timestamp; nil means not muted.
Controller exposes the toggle endpoint.
```

```text
feat(notifications): wire toggle UI to mute endpoint
```

The skill reports both hashes and subjects. Nothing is pushed.

## When to Reach For It

Use `ce-commit` when:

- You want the work on the local branch only
- You are mid-flow and will push later
- You want the repo's commit style and named-file staging handled for you

Skip it when:

- You also want a push and a PR -> `/ce-commit-push-pr`
- You need hunk-level splits -> `git add -p` yourself, then invoke this skill; agent-driven interactive staging is easy to get wrong, so the skill stays at file level
- There is nothing to commit. The skill reports that and stops.

---

## Chain Position

`ce-commit` is on-demand. It is not a required pipeline stage.

```text
/ce-work  ->  /ce-commit              (local only)
/ce-work  ->  /ce-commit-push-pr      (open a PR)

/ce-debug ->  /ce-commit              (when you pick commit-only on a branch you already had)
```

`/ce-work` and `/ce-debug` can hand off here when you choose not to open a PR. Most people invoke it directly.

## Reference

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| _(empty)_ | Commit current changes on this branch. Creates a feature branch first if HEAD is detached or on the default. |
| `<hint>` | Natural-language steer for the subject or which files to group, e.g. `commit the auth changes` |
| `exclude:<paths>` | Leave those files uncommitted no matter what else changed |

No mode flags. No push. No PR.

If you want the PR after all, run `/ce-commit-push-pr`. It continues from the commits already made rather than restarting.
