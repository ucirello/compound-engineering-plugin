## Problem

`AGENTS.md` stated that public Compound Engineering components use the `ce-` prefix to make ownership clear. But the rule was prose-only, and legacy skills sat unprefixed in the same directory as their `ce-`-prefixed siblings. The combination — a soft rule plus visible exceptions — let a new skill (`riffrec-feedback-analysis`) ship in PR #747 without the prefix. The user caught it post-merge of the first commit, requiring a rename commit on the same PR.

That skill is now `ce-riffrec-feedback-analysis`; `lfg` remains the sole intentional public-skill exemption.

The repo no longer ships standalone CE agents. Specialist reviewer, researcher, and helper behavior lives as skill-local prompt assets under `skills/*/references/agents/` or `skills/*/references/personas/`. Those internal filenames should be descriptive for the owning skill, not treated as public plugin component names.

## Root cause

Two layered problems:

1. **The rule was unenforced.** Nothing in CI or the test suite failed when a non-`ce-` public skill was added.
2. **The exception list was implicit.** Legacy skills predated the rule. Without an explicit allowlist, "predates the rule" looked identical to "the rule does not apply" when reading the filesystem.

## Solution

Make the public-skill rule mechanically enforced and pin exceptions explicitly.

### 1. Test enforcement

Enforcement lives in `tests/frontmatter.test.ts`, which walks root `skills/` directories and asserts the prefix on the directory name and frontmatter `name`. Exemptions are explicit:

```ts
const SKILL_PREFIX_ALLOWLIST = new Set([
  // lfg ships as the public command `/lfg` (see README.md).
  "lfg",
])
```

`tests/frontmatter.test.ts` still lists two additional historical names (`every-style-editor`, `file-todos`) that are not present under `skills/` (legacy-cleanup only). Live `skills/` matches the sole-`lfg` exemption; do not treat those extra allowlist entries as permission to add new unprefixed public skills.

The test also verifies each skill frontmatter `name` matches its parent directory and uses only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. That protects Pi and other native plugin loaders that reject punctuation-heavy names.

### 2. Strengthened prose

The public `ce-` rule is enforced by tests, not by an `AGENTS.md` "Naming Convention" heading (that section is gone). `AGENTS.md` still documents the complementary internal-asset rule under "Specialist Prompt Assets in Skills": skill-local personas stay unprefixed. Prose alone would not have prevented the original mistake; the CI allowlist is the load-bearing story.

### 3. Internal prompt assets stay internal

Do not use this rule as a reason to prefix every internal persona file. After the agentless restructure, names like `learnings-researcher.md` and `coherence-reviewer.md` are intentionally scoped by their owning skill directory. The public namespace is the skill name; the internal filename is just a prompt asset.

## Prevention

For any plugin convention that is prose-only, ask:

- Is there at least one visible counterexample in the codebase that an author could mistake for permission?
- Is there a mechanical check that would fail on violation?

If the answer to the first is yes and the second is no, the convention will eventually be violated. Add a test with a hard-coded allowlist, or migrate the legacy exceptions so the rule is universal.
