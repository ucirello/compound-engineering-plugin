# Repo-local fixes (Phase 2)

## Inline health-check equivalent (Step 2 fallback)

When the bundled `scripts/check-health` is unavailable, perform these checks by hand and report the same findings:

1. Check optional tools with `command -v`: `agent-browser`, `gh`, `jq`, `ast-grep`, `ffmpeg`.
2. If inside a JJ repository, resolve the absolute workspace root with `jj root` and run repository commands there.
3. Check for obsolete `rocketclaw.local.md` at the repo root.
4. Check whether `.rocketclaw/config.yaml` exists.
5. Check whether `.rocketclaw/config.local.yaml` exists and, if it does, run bundled `scripts/check-ignore.py <absolute-workspace-root> .rocketclaw/config.local.yaml`. This conservative read-only check reports complex ignore policy as needing manual verification rather than falsely claiming protection.
6. Compare `.rocketclaw/config.example.yaml` with `references/config-template.yaml` when the template is readable; otherwise report that the example refresh must be done manually.
7. Report a legacy Compound Codex tool map when `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/AGENTS.md` contains a standalone `<!-- BEGIN COMPOUND CODEX TOOL MAP -->` line followed by a standalone `<!-- END COMPOUND CODEX TOOL MAP -->` line.
8. Report the `node` row as available for optional compatibility cache maintenance when `node -p 'process.versions.node'` is 22.13 or newer and `command -v npx` succeeds; otherwise name which of the two is missing or too old. This does not block native peers; resolve model availability through `opencode.models`.

This file is read at two points: from Step 2 whenever the bundled health script is unavailable, for the inline equivalent above; and before any Phase 2 write, once Step 3 has decided that a writable checkout exists and which reported issues need remediation. Ask with the blocking question tool `references/communication.md` names. Maintaining the generated example files is the work this phase does on its own — Step 5's refresh and its removal of the superseded `config.local.example.yaml`. Every change to a user-owned file is offered and applied only if the user approves.

## Phase 2: Fix Repo-Local Issues

Resolve the absolute repository root (`jj root`) and change directory there. All paths below are relative to that root.

### Step 4: Remove Obsolete Local Config

If `rocketclaw.local.md` exists at the repo root, explain that it is obsolete because review-agent selection is automatic and surviving machine-local settings now live in `.rocketclaw/config.local.yaml` (the optional override). Team defaults live in `config.yaml`.

Ask whether to delete it now. Delete only if the user approves.

### Step 5: Refresh Example Config

Copy `references/config-template.yaml` to `<repo-root>/.rocketclaw/config.example.yaml`, creating the directory if needed. This file is committed to the repo and should always reflect the latest available settings. When the health report says the example was written by a newer plugin, leave it alone, so an older plugin never rolls it back.

If leftover `<repo-root>/.rocketclaw/config.local.example.yaml` remains after the new example exists, treat it as stale generated example (not user config) and remove it with `trash` (never `rm`).

If the bundled template cannot be located by the current platform, print the source template path that failed and tell the user the example config could not be refreshed automatically.

### Step 5a: Refresh Repo Config Files

When the health report says `config.yaml` was written from an older template, names a retired config key in either file, or calls `config.local.yaml` a full copy of the old local template, read `references/config-refresh.md` and follow it. A file the report says was written by a newer plugin, or cannot be refreshed, stays untouched.

### Step 6: Create Repo Config If Missing

If `.rocketclaw/config.yaml` does not exist, offer to create it, even when health is otherwise green. Explain that it holds shared RocketClaw settings, all initially commented out, and declining keeps the defaults.

If the user approves, copy `references/config-template.yaml` to `<repo-root>/.rocketclaw/config.yaml`. Change an existing `config.yaml` or `config.local.yaml` only through Step 5a's verified refresh or the repairs below.

If `config.local.yaml` already exists, leave it. After creating (or if both files already exist), name ordinary local keys that would shadow the new team file. If local still has `docs_root`, say it is ignored and offer to move it into `config.yaml`.

Do not create `config.local.yaml`.

### Step 6a: Repair Invalid Work Preferences

When the health report marks the Work implementation engine unavailable or invalid, or reports malformed dormant `work_engine_preferences`, do not guess the intended recipients. Retired routing keys such as `work_engine_target` are Step 5a's to remove, not this step's. Explain the exact reported problem, derive a valid ordered `work_engine_preferences` block from the user's stated harness/model order (or remove malformed dormant preferences and use `work_engine_mode: off` when they want native-by-default), and show the complete replacement block. Edit the layer that supplied the failing value. If the bad ordinary key is only in `config.yaml`, edit that file after preview. Do not hide a broken team value behind a new local override. Preserve every unrelated setting. Re-run the health check and require it to report either native or the intended normalized ordered list before setup is complete.

When the health report warns about `work_engine_effort`, the health status of the engine does not change, and the warning says what `ce-work` does with the value. A value that is not a map, or an entry for an unknown harness, requests nothing. A `cursor` entry is different: no Cursor route can run at an effort, so `ce-work` treats Cursor entries in the preference list as unavailable until the entry is removed. The key is a map from harness to one of that harness's own effort levels. Ask what effort the user wants for each harness rather than guessing, show the replacement map, and edit the layer the warning names. Re-run the health check and require the warning to be gone.

### Step 6b: Repair Invalid `docs_root`

When the health report marks `docs_root` invalid, explain the exact reason it gave (absolute, escapes the repo, `..` traversal, repo root, `.git/`, or a non-directory component) and the consequence: artifacts will not be written until it is fixed, because `docs_root` fails closed rather than silently falling back to `docs`. `docs_root` is read only from `.rocketclaw/config.yaml`. A `docs_root` in `config.local.yaml` is ignored — if local still has one, say so and offer to move it into `config.yaml`. Offer to either correct the tracked value to a valid repo-relative directory the user names, or remove the bad `docs_root` key from `config.yaml`. Removing it reaches the default `docs`. Edit only those keys after the user approves; preserve every unrelated setting. Re-run the health check and require it to report a resolved artifact root before setup is complete.

### Step 7: Ensure Local Config Is Gitignored

If `.rocketclaw/config.local.yaml` exists and is not covered by `.gitignore`, offer to add:

```text
.rocketclaw/*.local.yaml
```

Append the entry to the repo-root `.gitignore` only if the user approves. Do not overwrite unrelated `.gitignore` content.

### Step 8: Offer To Gitignore Scratch Space

Skills keep local scratch under `.tmp/`. Probe coverage with bundled `scripts/check-ignore.py <absolute-workspace-root> .tmp/`. Complex policy needs manual verification; do not claim it is safely ignored. When coverage is missing, offer to append this root rule:

```text
.tmp/
```

Append the entry to the repo-root `.gitignore` only if the user approves. Do not overwrite unrelated `.gitignore` content.

Unlike Step 7 this does not wait for the path to exist. The skill about to write there offers the same entry at its first write, so a repository that never uses one of those skills never needs the line — adding it here only means that prompt never has to fire.

### Step 9: Point Agents At The Knowledge Store, And Offer The Standing Directives

Runs whenever the repository has a root agent-instructions file (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or the equivalent this project uses). When one file only `@`-includes another, the substantive file is the target. No such file: skip this step and say so in the summary; setup never creates one.

**Outcome:** an agent that reads the file learns that the knowledge store exists at the resolved `<root>/solutions/` and when it is relevant, and the file carries a standing instruction for capturing learnings and one for the agent's own chat replies if the user wants them. Each addition is offered separately, previewed with its exact placement, and applied only on approval.

**Store mention.** Read the file and judge semantically, not by string match, whether a reader would learn three things: a store of documented solutions exists at the concrete path, enough of its shape to search it (categories, YAML frontmatter fields such as `module`, `tags`, `problem_type`), and that it is relevant when implementing or debugging in a documented area. When the spirit is met, offer nothing. Otherwise draft the smallest addition in the file's own style: one line in the closest existing section (a directory listing, architecture tree, conventions block) beats a new heading, and a new heading is the last resort. Keep the tone informational, not imperative, because an imperative causes redundant reads when a workflow already searches. Write the concrete resolved path, never the `<root>` placeholder, since people and plugin-less agents read this file. Calibration for a directory listing:

```text
<root>/solutions/  # documented solutions to past problems (bugs, best practices, workflow patterns), organized by category with YAML frontmatter (module, tags, problem_type)
```

**Compounding directive.** Offer it only when `jj file list <root>/solutions/` from the absolute workspace root lists at least one tracked file, or the user just accepted the store mention. An untracked or ignored directory is not evidence. Skip the offer if a standing instruction already invokes `ce-compound` at a completion checkpoint. Explain that agents would record a lesson whose reasoning the code alone does not show, so the next agent does not repeat the mistake. Offer ask-first, automatic, or no instruction.

Insert the chosen variant verbatim from `assets/compounding-directive.md` in this skill's directory; the wording is pinned by a test, so do not paraphrase it. Place it beside the store mention when that landed in a conventions or working-agreement block, otherwise in the block where the file states how agents should work. Match the surrounding form (a bullet in a bullet list, a paragraph in prose). Say where the text would go and what it asks agents to do, and show the exact text if the user asks. Append only on approval and leave the rest of the file untouched.

**Chat-register directive.** Offer it whenever this step runs. Skip the offer only when the file already carries an instruction that covers all three parts of the bundled one: the report boundary (a user-facing report, summary, or handoff about to be written), the invocation (use the `ce-noslop` skill for that writing), and the exclusions (code, config, verbatim quotes, text the user asked to post as written). A partial instruction, such as one naming only the boundary or a generic "write plainly", or an unrelated writing rule still gets the offer. The user should learn that agents' reports and summaries would then be written plainly, without AI writing habits, and that code and text they asked to post as written are untouched.

Insert the text verbatim from `assets/noslop-directive.md` in this skill's directory; do not paraphrase it. Place it beside the compounding directive when that landed or already exists, otherwise where the compounding directive would go. Match the surrounding form. Say where the text would go and what it asks agents to do, and show the exact text if the user asks. Append only on approval and leave the rest of the file untouched.

Report all three outcomes in the Phase 3 summary.

### Step 10: Offer Starting Drafts Of The Project's Review Docs

Read `references/project-docs.md` from this skill's directory and follow it. It makes one offer to draft or update `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `REVIEW.md`, and the agent-instructions lines and AI reviewer files that point to them, built from the repository's own review history, and writes nothing until the user approves the drafts.
