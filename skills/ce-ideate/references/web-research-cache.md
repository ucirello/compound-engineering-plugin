# Web Research Cache (V15)

Read this when checking the V15 cache before dispatching `web-researcher`, or when appending fresh research to the cache after dispatch. The behavior here is conditional — most invocations either hit the cache or write to it once and move on.

## Cache file shape

```json
[
  {
    "key": {
      "mode": "repo|elsewhere-software|elsewhere-non-software",
      "focus_hint_normalized": "<lowercase, whitespace-collapsed focus hint or empty string>",
      "topic_surface_hash": "<short hash of the user-supplied topic surface>"
    },
    "result": "<web-researcher output as plain text>",
    "ts": "<iso8601>"
  }
]
```

Files live under `<scratch-dir>/web-research-cache.json`, where `<scratch-dir>` is `<workspace-root>/.tmp/rocketclaw/ce-ideate/<run-id>` (or the current-directory `.tmp` fallback), resolved once in SKILL.md Phase 1.

## Reuse check

Before dispatching `web-researcher`, resolve the scratch root (the parent of `<scratch-dir>`) in bash and list sibling run-id directories — refinement loops within a session may legitimately reuse another run's cache by topic, not run-id:

```bash
WORKSPACE_ROOT="$(jj workspace root 2>/dev/null || pwd -P)"
SCRATCH_ROOT="$WORKSPACE_ROOT/.tmp/rocketclaw/ce-ideate"
find "$SCRATCH_ROOT" -maxdepth 2 -name 'web-research-cache.json' -type f 2>/dev/null
```

`find` exits 0 with empty output when no cache files exist, so the first-run case does not abort the reuse-check step.

Read each matching file. If any entry's `key` matches the current dispatch (same full mode variant — `repo`, `elsewhere-software`, or `elsewhere-non-software` — plus same case-insensitive normalized focus hint plus same topic surface hash), skip the dispatch and pass the cached `result` to the consolidated grounding summary. Mode variants must match exactly: `elsewhere-software` and `elsewhere-non-software` are distinct domains and must not cross-reuse. Note in the summary: "Reusing prior web research from this session — say 're-research' to refresh."

On `re-research` override, delete the matching entry and dispatch fresh.

## Append after fresh dispatch

After a fresh dispatch, append the new result to the current run's cache file at `<scratch-dir>/web-research-cache.json` using the absolute path from Phase 1 (create directory and file if needed). The next invocation in the session can reuse it via the `find` listing above.

## Topic surface hash

The topic surface is the user-supplied content the web research is grounded on:
- **Elsewhere modes (`elsewhere-software`, `elsewhere-non-software`):** the user's topic prompt plus any Phase 0.4 intake answers (the actual subject the agent is researching). The two sub-modes are keyed separately — a reclassification between software and non-software for the same topic hash must force a fresh dispatch, since the research domain differs.
- **Repo mode:** the focus hint plus a stable repo discriminator. This keeps the cache key meaningful when focus is empty — two bare-prompt invocations in the same repo legitimately share research, but the key still differentiates repos. Resolve the discriminator with this fallback chain and hash the result (first 8 hex chars of sha256 is sufficient):
    1. Use `gh` to resolve the canonical GitHub `owner/repo` identity, normalize every URL from `jj git remote list` to that form, and use the canonical URL only when exactly one remote matches.
    2. Otherwise use the complete `jj git remote list` output normalized by remote name and canonicalized URL, sorted by remote name. This is stable without assuming `origin`; skip it when the listing is empty.
    3. `jj workspace root` — absolute workspace path; machine-local but available in a Jujutsu workspace.
    4. The current working directory's absolute path — last resort when not in a Jujutsu workspace.

Normalize focus hints and topic text by lowercasing and collapsing whitespace. Hash the repo discriminator after applying the canonicalization and sorting rules above.

## Degradation

If the cache file is unreachable across invocations on the current platform (filesystem isolation, sandboxing, ephemeral working directory), degrade to "no reuse, dispatch every time." Surface the limitation in the consolidated grounding summary and proceed without reuse rather than inventing a capability the platform may not have.
