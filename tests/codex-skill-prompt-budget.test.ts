/**
 * Two shipping hosts route on a root `plugin.json` `$schema` under the Agent Plugins prefix,
 * and both break this plugin when they do:
 *
 * - Codex >= 0.147 (openai/codex#37027, #1412) injects only the first MAX_SKILL_PROMPT_BYTES
 *   (8000) of each Agent Plugin SKILL.md; 26 skills exceed that.
 * - oh-my-pi >= 17.3 (#1411) rejects any SKILL.md whose frontmatter has a key outside the
 *   Agent Skills closed set; the Claude Code keys `argument-hint` / `disable-model-invocation`
 *   are load-bearing, so 30 skills vanish. omp has no per-host override.
 *
 * So the root manifest stays schema-less unconditionally (docs/specs/agent-plugins.md); a
 * strict client that needs conformance gets a separately emitted package. Independently, no
 * new skill may cross Codex's byte bound, and OVER_BUDGET shrinks as skills are restructured.
 *
 * Provenance of the number (verified 2026-08-21): 8000 is Codex's MAX_SKILL_PROMPT_BYTES, NOT
 * an Agent Plugins requirement. The spec has no size limit of any kind, and the Agent Skills
 * spec it defers to constrains only frontmatter -- its body guidance ("< 5000 tokens", "under
 * 500 lines") is explicitly a recommendation. A second, independent host bound exists and is
 * deliberately not gated separately here: Claude Code auto-compaction re-attaches each invoked
 * skill keeping only its first 5,000 tokens, within a 25,000-token combined budget filled from
 * the most recently invoked (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills). Only its PER-SKILL half is
 * approximated here, and a byte count never proves a token count: 8000 bytes is ~2000 tokens at
 * ordinary prose density, and breaching 5,000 tokens within 8000 bytes would take ~1.6 bytes per
 * token, which Markdown prose does not reach. Treat that as a wide margin, not a guarantee -- a
 * token-dense body erodes it, and a green run here is not a token-bound proof. Its COMBINED 25,000-token half is an aggregate over every
 * skill invoked in one session, which a per-file check cannot express: at ~4 bytes/token an
 * 8000-byte body is ~2000 tokens, so ~12 fully compliant skills exhaust it and the oldest are
 * then dropped entirely. That invariant is deliberately UNGUARDED -- this file sizes each
 * SKILL.md independently and no other test covers the aggregate. Do not read a green run here as
 * proof the compaction budget is safe. Both truncations keep the START of the file, which is why
 * a body's ordering is load-bearing: what must survive goes above what may be cut.

 * skill. Emptying this set is a standing goal (the precondition for a conformant Agent Plugins
 * package), not a nice-to-have — see docs/solutions/skill-design/size-driven-skill-restructure.md
