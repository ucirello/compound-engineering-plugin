# `ce-brainstorm`

> Think through what something should become, one question at a time, then write a right-sized requirements-only unified plan.

`ce-brainstorm` is the **definition** skill. Use it when you have a direction and the open question is "what does this need to be?" It asks one question per turn, pressure-tests premises against named gap lenses, lays out 2-3 concrete approaches before recommending one, and, for software, writes a requirements-only unified plan so planning does not invent product behavior.

It runs on software features, on non-software topics (events, business decisions, travel, naming briefs), and on work in between. Software runs write the requirements-only unified plan. Non-software runs stay in facilitation mode: a chat synthesis, then an optional handoff to `ce-plan` for a domain-appropriate plan.

This is the middle step in the compound-engineering ideation chain. Skip it when you already have requirements, or when you do not yet have a direction:

```text
/ce-ideate         /ce-brainstorm      /ce-plan             /ce-work
"What's worth      "What does this     "What's needed       "Build it."
 exploring?"        need to be?"        to accomplish
                                        this?"
```

It is also a common standalone entry when the question is not "how do I do it?" but "what am I actually doing, and is that the right shape?"

It does not render a verdict. If the request is a whether-to-adopt decision on a named external candidate (a technology, library, pattern, platform, or architecture, judged against this project), the skill offers `/ce-pov` instead of scoping work you have not committed to. That is an offer, not a silent switch. Open-ended design with no single candidate stays here.

## TL;DR

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What does it do? | Collaborative dialogue to clarify scope, pressure-test premises, explore approaches, and write a requirements-only unified plan |
| When to use it | Vague feature ideas, multiple plausible directions, unclear scope, work in unfamiliar territory, non-software decisions |
| What it produces | Software: a requirements-only unified plan in `docs/plans/` with `artifact_readiness: requirements-only` and R/A/F/AE IDs. Non-software: chat synthesis, optional save, optional Proof publish, optional handoff to `ce-plan`. Lightweight alignment can skip the doc. |
| What's next | Software: create the implementation plan (`ce-plan`, recommended), ship autonomously with `lfg`, pressure-test the requirements or prototype a remaining feel-question, open an HTML artifact in the browser, or keep asking. Non-software: create a plan, save the summary, publish to Proof, or stop. |

## Example invocations

An empty invoke asks what to explore. A path to an existing requirements-only plan offers resume. `output:html` changes the artifact format. A named model elevates only approach generation.

```text
# Ask what to explore, then start the dialogue
/ce-brainstorm

# Shape an ambitious feature or project before committing to a plan
/ce-brainstorm design a self-serve migration platform for enterprise customers

# Turn a rough feature idea into a requirements artifact
/ce-brainstorm add a way for users to pause notifications

# Explore a problem without prescribing the solution up front
/ce-brainstorm support agents get paged overnight for non-urgent events

# Resume or continue an existing requirements-only plan instead of starting a duplicate
/ce-brainstorm docs/plans/2026-08-10-feat-notification-mute-plan.md

# Name an ideate survivor already in this conversation. Its tagged basis,
# rationale, and tradeoffs travel with it (same as picking "Brainstorm one idea")
/ce-brainstorm the per-channel mute idea

# Brainstorm non-software work with the same one-question discipline
/ce-brainstorm plan a two-day customer advisory workshop

# Unfamiliar territory: offer a blindspot map before questioning that area
/ce-brainstorm I know nothing about color grading but need a review workflow for it

# Verdict-shaped: offer ce-pov rather than scoping an adoption you have not made
/ce-brainstorm should we adopt Biome in this repo?

# Ask for a self-contained HTML artifact in plain language
/ce-brainstorm add account-level notification settings and make the artifact a self-contained HTML page

# Equivalent shorthand when a repeatable automation needs it
/ce-brainstorm add account-level notification settings output:html

# Keep the session on your usual model; generate the approaches on a named one
/ce-brainstorm add account-level notification settings, use fable
```

Use `ce-ideate` when you do not yet have a direction. Use `ce-pov` when the candidates are already named and you need a verdict. Use `ce-plan` when the product shape is already settled.

## The Problem

Going straight from a vague idea to implementation produces:

- Work that solves the wrong problem, because nobody pressure-tested the premise
- Scope creep, because boundaries were never written down
- Plans that re-litigate product decisions every time someone touches them
- Requirements that are either over-ceremonial PRDs nobody updates, or one-line briefs that planning has to fill in by guessing

A typical "let's brainstorm" with an AI has shape problems too. It asks five questions in one message; you answer two and the rest get lost. It picks one approach immediately instead of showing alternatives. It bakes implementation into product discussion. The output is conversation, not a handoff-able artifact.

## The Solution

`ce-brainstorm` runs a structured conversation that can end in a durable artifact:

- One question per turn, defaulting to the platform's blocking question tool
- Facts the environment can answer are looked up, not asked; a running lookup does not stall independent questions
- User terms or system-behavior claims that conflict with existing `CONCEPTS.md` or verified code are challenged when they would change a product decision
- Ceremony matched to the work: Lightweight, Standard, Deep, or Deep-product
- Named gap lenses on premises before approaches are generated
- An opt-in blindspot pass when you do not know the territory well enough to weigh options
- A background grounding scout that gathers verbatim repo evidence while you answer the opening questions
- 2-3 concrete approaches with tradeoffs, then a stated recommendation
- Opt-in visual probes for decisions that are faster to judge as rough sketches than as prose
- An optional `ce-prototype` offer when committing an approach would be expensive to unravel and neither talk nor a cheap sketch can settle it
- A Synthesis Summary as the last cheap moment to correct scope before a doc lands
- Fresh-context claim verification of the doc's repo claims before it lands
- One coherent work unit per artifact
- A Ready for Planning Check that repairs completeness, consistency, focus, and planning-readiness before handoff
- A right-sized Product Contract inside a unified plan, with stable R/A/F/AE identifiers that flow into planning

## What Makes It Novel

### 1. One question at a time

Stacking several questions in one message produces diluted answers. `ce-brainstorm` asks one question per turn and defaults to the platform's blocking question tool with single-select options when natural choices exist. Free-text is always available. It also asks only decisions: if the repo, the grounding dossier, or another reachable source can settle the answer, it looks that up instead of putting it to you. A lookup in flight does not stall questions that do not depend on it. When your wording conflicts with existing `CONCEPTS.md` or with verified code in a way that would change a product decision, it surfaces that conflict before treating the wording as settled. It does not create `CONCEPTS.md`; glossary writes still land after the plan.

### 2. Ceremony scales with the work

Lightweight covers small, well-bounded ideas and ends in chat: a paragraph naming what is being built, the one or two decisions made, and where they go next — no file, no grounding scout, no approach generation. A file is written only when the dialogue produced a decision a downstream consumer needs in IDed form, or you ask for one. Standard handles ordinary features with some decisions. Deep adds probes for cross-cutting work. Deep-product also has to establish product shape (actors, core outcome, positioning, durability) rather than inherit it.

### 3. Named gap lenses, then approaches

Before generating approaches, the skill scans the opening for rigor gaps and probes only the ones that are present:

- Evidence: "users want X" with no observable behavior behind it
- Specificity: the beneficiary is abstract, so design will invent who they are
- Counterfactual: no visibility into what people do today, or what changes if nothing ships
- Attachment: a specific solution shape is already being treated as the thing being built
- Durability (Deep-product only): value rests on a current state of the world that may shift

These probes fire as prose, not menus. A 4-option menu would tell you which kinds of evidence count. Prose forces a real observation.

Phase 2 then surfaces 2-3 concrete approaches, including at least one non-obvious angle (inversion, constraint removal, or cross-domain analogy). Approaches sit at mechanism or product-shape granularity, not architecture. Architecture on thin research belongs in `ce-plan`. Approaches are shown before the recommendation so you see the alternatives first.

### 4. Visual probes, then prototype when a sketch is not enough

When a decision is spatial, behavioral, or visual, the skill can offer a rough local visual probe. Those probes are disposable sketches for product feedback, display-only. You respond in chat. A decision a rough sketch cannot settle (finish or motion), or one a sketch was built for and failed to settle, routes to `ce-prototype` instead.

### 5. Synthesis, identifiers, and a last check before handoff

Before writing the doc, the skill emits a scoping synthesis: what is being built, the trade-offs the dialogue produced, what was deferred, and any genuine forks. Lightweight runs that asked no blocking questions compress this to a single forward-looking sentence. Standard, Deep, and any run that asked a blocking question get the full synthesis and an explicit confirmation gate, including a richly pre-loaded opener that needed no dialogue.

The Product Contract carries R-IDs (Requirements), A-IDs (Actors), F-IDs (Key Flows), and AE-IDs (Acceptance Examples). `ce-plan` traces every implementation unit and test scenario back to them. Origin scope boundaries, including "Outside this product's identity", flow through unchanged.

Requirements describe expected behavior from the user's perspective. They do not describe libraries, schemas, endpoints, file layouts, or code structure unless the brainstorm itself is about a technical decision.

A decision you examined and chose during the dialogue lands as a labeled Key Decision (`session-settled: user-directed` or `user-approved`) and is not re-asked. `ce-plan` inherits the label.

On Standard and Deep software runs, a cheap scout gathers a grounding dossier (verbatim quotes with `file:line` pointers) while you answer the first question. Before the plan is written, a verifier that never saw the dialogue checks the Product Contract's repo claims. Refuted claims are corrected; unverifiable ones become explicit assumptions. The dossier path is handed to `ce-plan`.

### 6. Blindspot pass and non-software facilitation

When you flag unfamiliarity, or consecutive answers show you cannot weigh the options, the skill offers a blindspot pass before questioning that territory further: a map of 3-7 decisions and hazards, each with why it matters, the realistic options, and a recommended default. You pick which to walk through. The rest take defaults recorded as explicit assumptions. This works on both software and non-software routes.

Non-software work uses a domain-agnostic facilitator with the same one-question discipline. It does not write a software unified-plan artifact.

---

## Quick Example

You start with "I want to add a way for users to pause notifications." The skill classifies the work as Standard and sends a cheap background scout for repo evidence while you answer the first question.

The pressure test finds a specificity gap (who are these "users"?) and an attachment gap ("pause" is already a solution shape). It probes both as prose, one at a time. You name the actual pain (support gets pinged at 3 AM for non-urgent stuff) and the smallest version that would solve it.

Three approaches surface: per-notification-type mute with TTL, a global do-not-disturb schedule, mute on the rule rather than the channel. Tradeoffs and a recommendation follow. The Synthesis Summary reads back the shape ("per-channel mute on notification rules, 24h preset for the 3 AM support pings"), the trade-offs (per-channel over per-user, mute lives on the rule), what is deferred (presence-based mute, quiet-hours schedules), and a call-out about the rule-delete loss path. You confirm and add a 24h preset.

A requirements-only unified plan is written under `docs/plans/`. The Phase 4 menu then offers: create the implementation plan with `ce-plan` (recommended), ship autonomously with `lfg`, pressure-test the requirements or prototype a remaining feel-question, open the file if it is HTML, or keep asking clarifying questions.

## When to Reach For It

Reach for `ce-brainstorm` when:

- A feature idea is partly formed and you cannot yet sketch the implementation
- A request has several valid solutions and you need to choose
- The scope is unclear ("add notifications": what kind, for whom, when)
- You want a structured artifact you can hand to another person or to planning
- You have to scope work in territory you do not know (the blindspot pass maps the decision surface first)
- The topic is not software (naming, events, roadmap choices)

Skip `ce-brainstorm` when:

- You do not yet know what to work on → `/ce-ideate`
- Requirements are already specified (a PRD exists, the issue is detailed) → `/ce-plan`
- The request is whether to adopt a named external candidate → `/ce-pov`
- You have a known root cause for a bug → `/ce-debug`
- The change is already specified down to the files it touches → just do it, or `/ce-work`

## Use as Part of the Chained Workflow

```text
/ce-ideate          (optional: discover candidate directions)
   |  picks one survivor and carries its basis, rationale, and tradeoffs
   v
/ce-brainstorm
   |  produces a requirements-only unified plan
   |  software: R-IDs, A-IDs, F-IDs, AE-IDs and scope boundaries
   |  non-software: chat synthesis, optional handoff to ce-plan
   v
/ce-plan
   |  enriches the same plan to implementation-ready
   |  R-IDs flow into Requirements; A/F/AE-IDs trace into units and tests
   |  origin scope boundaries are preserved
   v
/ce-work
```

When `ce-plan` loads with a requirements-only unified plan, it does not re-litigate product behavior. The Product Contract is authoritative. Plan-time decisions are about execution guardrails, not what is being built.

In a repo, acting on an ideate survivor always comes here, not to `ce-plan`. `ce-plan` wants a brainstorm-grounded Product Contract.

---

## Use Standalone

Many teams skip `ce-ideate` (they already know what to explore). Some also stop here and treat the brainstorm as the thinking artifact, then plan later.

- Feature briefs: turn a vague idea into a stable artifact for stakeholders or new contributors
- Onboarding existing work: the feature is in flight but the rationale was never written down
- Pre-PR alignment: several people need to agree on scope before code starts
- Strategic decisions: Deep-product surfaces durability and adjacent-product risks
- Non-software: name a product, plan an event, decide a roadmap

The software Phase 4 menu offers planning, autonomous ship with `lfg` (when a unified plan exists and no blockers remain), document review or a prototype, an HTML open-in-browser option, or more questions. There is no skip-to-`ce-work` from this menu. Non-software wrap-up offers `ce-plan`, save the summary, publish to Proof, or stop.

If a related requirements-only plan already exists, the skill offers to resume it instead of starting a duplicate.

## Reference

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| _(empty)_ | Asks what you would like to explore |
| `<feature idea>` | Open-ended brainstorm |
| `<problem>` | Routes through the product pressure test |
| Existing requirements-only plan path, legacy `*-requirements.md` path, or matching topic | Resume offer |
| Ideate survivor already in this conversation | Loads with that idea's tagged basis, rationale, and tradeoffs |
| Verdict-shaped prompt (`should we adopt X`) | Offers `ce-pov`; decline and the brainstorm continues |
| `output:html` | Write the requirements-only unified plan as a single self-contained HTML file instead of markdown. Exclusive: the artifact is `.md` or `.html`, never both. Default is markdown. Set `brainstorm_output: html` in CE config (`config.local.yaml` then `config.yaml`) to make HTML the default. Pipeline mode (LFG, `disable-model-invocation`) always forces markdown. See the [configuration reference](./configuration.md). |
| `use fable` / `have opus generate these` | Elevate only approach generation to that model. Also settable as `brainstorm_model: <model>` in CE config. A prompt request overrides the config key. |

## FAQ

**Why one question at a time? Isn't that slow?**
Stacking three questions per turn produces diluted answers. People pick the easy one and the rest get lost. One question per turn produces sharper answers and usually converges faster.

**Why does it pressure-test my premise? I just want to brainstorm.**
The named gap lenses catch the usual ways feature briefs fail downstream. They fire only when the gap is actually present. A concrete, well-framed prompt can earn zero probes.

**Can I skip the requirements-only plan?**
Yes. The Lightweight tier and the announce-mode fast path support that. If you only need brief alignment, no doc is written. The `lfg` menu option is hidden when there is no artifact, because `lfg` cannot prompt for the missing file.

**What if I already have a PRD or detailed GitHub issue?**
Skip `ce-brainstorm` and go to `/ce-plan`. The plan skill consumes any kind of input.

**What does "Inferred" mean in the synthesis?**
The agent composes an internal three-bucket draft (Stated / Inferred / Out of scope) before presenting the scoping synthesis. Inferred items are bets that fill dialogue gaps. Those that survive the keep test surface as call-outs; the rest dissolve into the Product Contract when you confirm.

**Does it work for non-software topics?**
Yes. A domain-agnostic facilitator keeps the one-question discipline. The wrap-up can hand the synthesis to `ce-plan`, save a summary, or publish to Proof. It does not write a software unified-plan artifact.

**Can I go straight to `ce-work` from here?**
Not from the Phase 4 menu. Software next steps are `ce-plan` or `lfg` (which plans first). Skip-to-build is not offered here, even for Lightweight scope.

## Model elevation

When you want a specific model for the heavy reasoning step, `ce-brainstorm` can generate approaches on that model instead of your session model. Only approach generation is dispatched, with read access so it can verify its brief. The rest of the skill stays on your session model. Name a model in the prompt (`use fable`, `have opus generate these`), or set `brainstorm_model: <model>` in CE config (`config.local.yaml` then `config.yaml`). A prompt request overrides the config key.

This works on any harness. The host serves the chosen model natively where it can, otherwise it invokes the Claude CLI (which must be installed and authenticated), otherwise it runs the step on your session model and says which precondition was unmet. Setting `brainstorm_model` therefore takes effect in every harness you run `ce-brainstorm` in, not just Claude Code.
